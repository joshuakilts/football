Fully fractional in this sense means a 19 yd fg = 1.9 pts, while a 39 yd fg = 3.9 pts.  We got the usual debates:\n\n*\"The Kickers will get less than 3 pts for a fg!\"*\n\n*\"The 19 yd chip shot takes less skill than a 39 yd fg!\"* \n\n*\"Why do we even have Kickers at all????\"*\n\nI decided to review the 2020 season and see how much of a difference it would actually make.\n\n# 2020 Data\n\n|Kicker|Regular Scoring|Fully Fractional Scoring|Difference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Jason Sanders|136|142.1|\\+6.1|\n|Younghoe Koo|135|141|\\+6|\n|Greg Zuerlein|120|129.6|\\+9.6|\n|Matt Prater|117|121.9|\\+4.9|\n|Brandon McManus|112|117.1|\\+5.1|\n|Graham Gano|112|122.4|\\+10.4|\n|Daniel Carlson|110|106.8|\\-3.2|\n|Rodrigo Blankenship|107|109.8|\\+2.8|\n|Cairo Santos|103|106.1|\\+3.1|\n|Tyler Bass|100|103.6|\\+3.6|\n|Dustin Hopkins|98|104.6|\\+6.6|\n|Joey Slye|96|97.9|\\+1.9|\n|Ka'imi Fairbairn|95|98.8|\\+3.8|\n|Ryan Succop|93|96.3|\\+3.3|\n|Justin Tucker|93|97.4|\\+4.4|\n|Nick Folk|93|96.4|\\+3.4|\n|Jason Myers|89|98.4|\\+9.4|\n|Harrison Butker|86|87.6|\\+1.6|\n|Michael Badgley|84|85.9|\\+1.9|\n|Wil Lutz|78|83.6|\\+5.6|\n|Randy Bullock|76|82.3|\\+6.3|\n|Stephen Gostkowski|73|76.8|\\+3.8|\n|Robbie Gould|70|73.4|\\+3.4|\n|Zane Gonzalez|60|64.9|\\+4.9|\n|Dan Bailey|53|52.4|\\-0.6|\n\n^(Notes: Scoring includes FGs only.  Regular scoring is 0-39 yds = 3pts, 40-49 yds = 4pts, 50+ = 5pts)\n\nBased on my crude statistical analysis (not an expert), I actually concluded that the difference in scoring is *statistically significant*.  Even with that fact, the average difference turned out to be a miniscule +0.28 pts per game.  In my opinion, going to fully fractional is a more fair representation of made FGs and, based on the data, it is not going to adversely increase Kickers scoring.", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Kickers - Full Fractional vs. Regular Scoring", "created": 1629172157.0, "players": ["Graham Gano", "Matt Prater", "Nick Folk", "Robbie Gould", "Ryan Succop", "Stephen Gostkowski", "Dan Bailey", "Randy Bullock", "Greg Zuerlein", "Justin Tucker", "Dustin Hopkins", "Brandon McManus", "Cairo Santos", "Jason Myers", "Ka'imi Fairbairn", "Wil Lutz", "Zane Gonzalez", "Harrison Butker", "Younghoe Koo", "Daniel Carlson", "Jason Sanders", "Michael Badgley", "Joey Slye", "Rodrigo Blankenship", "Tyler Bass"]}, {"author": "JPnightmare", "created_utc": 1628632982, "id": "p1zexd", "score": 1, "selftext": "**Quarterback (QB)**\n\n**Tier 1**\n\n1.

Basically how it works is you fill out your top 40, then subtract points for how far off you were.   \n\nExample:   \n\n- If you have Mahomes at #1 and he actually ends up at #5, it's -4 points (1-5). If you have him at #5 and he ends up at #1, it's still -4 points as the difference.      \n- If you have Mahomes at #1 and he ends up at #1, it's 0 points.   \n- If you put any player in the top 40 and they don't end up being on the list, you subtract 101 from whichever rank you had them at. So if you have Mahomes at #1, yet he doesn't make the top 100, you get -100 points (1-101). If you have Mahomes at #40 and he doesn't make the top 100, you get -61 points (40-101).   \n- The theoretical best score is 0 points if you get everything exactly right, and the theoretical worst score is -3,220 if you either name 40 players who all didn't make the top 100, or just don't fill it out.     \n\nHere are my choices (for reference, 41-100 are the players that have already been listed on the NFL Top 100):   \n\n**1.

I then used the IFP data to compare the value of each player compared to the player with the next highest IFP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Caveats:**\n\nIt's important to note that rushing Yds and TDs prop bets did not exist for most QBs, in which case I simply took the data from 2020, extrapolated it to account for injuries and cover a 17 game season, and rounded it to the nearest 5. These QBs are denoted with an \\*. Dak is denoted with \\*\\* because for whatever reason TD prop bets existed but Yds did not  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af. It's also important to note that I did not include Ints, Fumbles, 2-point conversions, etc, in the IFP projection. Lastly, FP Auction Value is based on a 10 team league with standard scoring because that's what my main league is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are the results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9i1c9ds5x0i71.png?width=2502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5498f2aa8ab13031ee8cb829f1ff9a63d9a20f\n\n**Things worth noting:**\n\nThe first thing that pops out to me are the distinct tiers. Allen and Mahomes are in a clear tier 1, followed by Kyler, Lamar, Dak, and Russ in tier 2, Rodgers, Tannehill, Brady, and Herbert in tier 3, and then a no man's land. Beyond that, there are, IMO, 3 noteworthy discrepancies between this data and the FantasyPros rankings. The first is that not only does DraftKings like Russel Wilson more than Aaron Rodgers, which is the flip of FP, it actually has him projected to be a notable tier above Rodgers. The second is that Ryan Tannehill is being slept on. The third is that Justin Herbert is being overvalued.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that fantasy players and sports betters value things differently. For example, the discrepancy between Rodgers and Wilson could be explained by the fact that a fantasy player will value consistency whereas a sports better only cares about the end value. Another example is that Jalen Hurts and Ryan Tannehill may have the same FP value despite significantly different DK values because Hurts has the potential for a Lamar QB1 style season whereas Tannehill does not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Last words:**\n\nIf you're interested in similar posts for the other positions please let me know. I'll probably be doing it for myself anyway so it's no trouble. \n\nAlso, I'm interested in using this data to find the true auction value of a player compared to the value of the #1 drafted player of that position (so for every $1 that Josh Allen goes for what fraction of $1 should a given QB be going for?) but I'm not sure how to do it because just taking the % differences between the two projections and getting a fractional value doesn't account for tier-based advantages/scarcity.

So I made a thread like this yesterday, and someone asked me to include a larger listing of QB placements rather than just the top 10. So I re-tackled the exploration. I did make some other small changes in methodology, however, to cut down on little-known QBs making the list. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Methodology\n\n**Three-Year Increments**\n\nEPA is often rated as \u201cMost important, not stable, fine predictor, best process/formula\u201d. EPA is IMO the most objective and comprehensive formula by a big margin, but it does have a stability issue where graphing QBs year-to-year can be volatile. To address its stability issue and smooth the curve, I am looking at a rolling three-year increment of time. So, the first increment is 1999-2001, then 2000-2002, then 2001-2003, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EPA/Play**\n\nEPA is explained as being \u201cbased on historical mathematical chances a team will score based on the field position and down. For example, the expected points before a 1st and 10 from midfield is about 2. A 10-yard gain would result in a 1st and 10 from the 40 for an EP of about 2.5, meaning the previous play has an EPA of 0.5. EPA is great at eliminating the value of empty yards, a 9-yard gain on 3rd and 20 isn\u2019t actually very valuable but for stats like passer rating and total yards, that play is just as valuable as any other 9-yard gain. EPA considers all plays impacted by the QB, so attempts, sacks, scrambles, QB runs, etc.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Garbage Time**\n\nWhen a team is \"comfortably ahead\", they change their strategy from trying to stop the losing team to allowing the losing team to make progress in exchange for burning time off the clock. This time, I have moved the garbage time filter designed by the analysts to its max to ensure that both QBs in the game are playing to score at the time and not strategically burning time, etc. More importantly, it helped filter out a ton of backup QBs from being present in listings, cutting down the tldr.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Time Period Captured (1999-2020)**\n\nKeep in mind, for a few names, with Favre being the most recognizable, their ability is not fully captured due to the EPA data beginning in 1999. So only the latter years are captured, which are sometimes not their prime years (Favre's three consecutive MVP years preceded 1999). Favre STILL qualified for the prestigious \u201cIron Man\u201d mean calculation with only half his career though. The beast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chronological Appearances\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began listing QBs when they first appeared and met a minimum of non-garbage-time plays over a given period. This occurred earlier for some QBs than others, so it may not precisely correlate when they joined the NFL if they did not stay healthy or were not made the primary starter early on. Within their year-increment sub-categories, they are organized by set size. The notation of (1, 2..) would be 1st in the first increment they appeared, 2nd in the second increment they appeared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1999-2001**\n\nP.

This was originally designed to be a ranking of the top 100  players in the league, regardless of position, for the upcoming season.  And while this has more and more become a comparison of resumes and  altered its criteria, in the spirit of what this was intended to be, I  listed what I thought were the very best players, in relation to how  good they are at their position coming into 2021. What I changed this  year was actually putting ratings on these players \u2013 sort of Madden  style \u2013 and one by one incorporating them into the list, while debating  back and forth when multiple guys shared the same number.\n\nThere are six names to start off with, who didn\u2019t qualify for my  list. I believe they all deserve to be on it, but I just didn\u2019t know  where to put them, because of how long it\u2019s been since we\u2019ve seen them  on the field, how often they\u2019ve gotten hurt recently or because we just  don\u2019t know if/when we will see them play again.\n\nI also added the 30 names that just missed the cut. So it\u2019s almost a  top 130, because I always have a tough time leaving those names off, but  I feel pretty good about the ultimate rankings that I put together  here.\n\nFor analysis, just click on the video, where I work my way from the bottom to the top!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbNE0KxkrwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbNE0KxkrwE)  \n\n\nThe official countdown premieres two days from now, but I\u2019m filming this here on August 4th  \u2013 just in case any players were to suffer an injury or some other news  coming out, that would change the availability of certain players. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n### Did not qualify:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijc078tlt4h71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c59e459a108cb587959379d6a88c53aa29ce94d6\n\n \n\nMichael Thomas \u2013 foot surgery in late July leads to uncertainty of when he\u2019ll be available\n\nDerwin James \u2013 only five total games over these last 2 years combined\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. \u2013 played in just 25 total games over these last four years\n\nDanielle Hunter \u2013 scary back surgery before last season even started, is something I want to see play out first\n\nMitchell Schwartz \u2013 currently still a free agent, who has hinted at possible retirement\n\nDeshaun Watson \u2013 for obvious reason, he\u2019s a top 15 player in the league otherwise\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# The list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezqd01ert4h71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=480f999d1fb85967293927e35f8ec71924b7c140\n\n \n\n1.

My values are based on yahoo mock drafts so forgive me if other platforms are rating players differently \n\n1. Ryan Tannehill- I'm hesitant to put a QB this high because you can usually find a perfectly fine QB late in the draft or stream, but Tanny is terrifyingly low as the 8th-10th QB off the board. His previous two seasons plus Julio Jones make him an easy top 5 QB this year, probably top 3.\n\n2. Darrell Henderson- Henderson is likely going to begin this season as a bellcow for the offense that ran the ball the most last year in the entire league. Stafford replacing Goff definitely curbs my enthusiasm a little bit. However, getting bellcow amounts of carries and coming off the board in the 4th round is insane value.\n\n3. Tyler Boyd- Why is the slot reciever on such a high volume passing offense going so low? Jamarr Chase is a stud, but the A.J. Green/Auden Tate targets and Tee Higgins targets were aplenty last year and Boyd still feasted almost every single week. He's remarkably safe week to week and I've seen him come off the board as late as the 10th and 11th rounds.\n\n4. Adam Thielen- I contemplated putting him over Boyd, but he is going higher on average than Boyd. This man is being drafted like he's a FLEX and not one of the most dominant and safe receivers in the league. Thielen is a monster and Jefferson really opens up the field for him. I don't see any reason why he shouldn't finish in the WR 8-14 range and he's going in the 6th round or thereabouts.\n\n5. Josh Jacobs- I don't get all the hesitancy on Jacobs while Zeke has surged back to the top of draft boards. Kenyan Drake really isn't scaring me that much. The goal line opportunities and Gruden's old school style should still yield opportunities for Jacobs. He isn't quite the slam dunk that Henderson should be, but Jacobs is a solid pick in the 4th round \n\n6. Logan Thomas- I love all things Football Team this year. They should steamroll the NFC East, even with a murky QB situation. Teams have to deal with that 1-2 backfield punch and Terry who just might be the most skilled receiver in the league. Thomas is an athletic freak, WFT gave him big money and I think Fitz is going to target him in the redzone.\n\n7. Arizona D- This is not a joke. I'm a firm believer in being the last guy to draft a defense because of the volatility of the position. You can almost assuredly get them with your last pick and I firmly believe they will lead the league in sacks and Isaiah Simmons is the most versatile defensive player in the league. Plus their offense could take like 7 minutes on every drive which helps.\n\n8. Raheem Mostert- Mostert is going in the 9th round most of the time and even with the arrival of Trey Sermon, I think Mostert, like usual, is going to be a very efficient start until his obligatory injury. I'm fine cashing him in my FLEX spot early in the year to rack up some wins.\n\n9. Trevor Lawrence- I wouldn't make him your QB1 off the board. Maybe if Jax's offense gets rolling through the preseason then you can consider it. He's a fantastic stash if you get stuck in no man's land when the QB avalanche happens. He is an amazing prospect with some very solid weapons to begin his career. Could be a Justin Herbert type player and you can get him in the 11th round. \n\n10. Gus Edwards- With Ingram gone, Edwards should get a sizeable amount of carries in a run heavy offense. Not to mention, any injury to Dobbins makes Edwards a RB1 on volume and scheme alone.\n\nHonorable mentions: Michael Thomas and Deshaun Watson- Anytime recent fantasy juggernauts are going super low, a flier is never a bad idea. If both guys get their shit together and end up on the field, they are going to be great.", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Top 10 value picks regardless of position", "created": 1628661816.0, "players": ["A.J.

I used [overthecap](https://overthecap.com/free-agency/) for signings which is good but not the best so I am sure I missed some.  I also used [football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) for stats, [Ourlads](https://www.ourlads.com/nfldepthcharts/) for player relevance and past depth charts, and [pro football history](https://pro-football-history.com/) for coaching changes.  I'm sure some mistakes were made along the way and I did this in my spare time over the course of the past couple months so some updates might have been missed as well so be gentle and I'll be happy to make edits/corrections because I'm not a sports writer, this was for me and I am happy to share.  \n\n#Falcons\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. Arthur Smith comes on as the head coach after it was clear that Raheem Morris wasn\u2019t the right coach for the job in the first year.  Arthur had some serious success as the Titans OC seeing as he made very productive players out of Tannehill and Corey Davis who had previously only shown talent but not an ability to put it to consistent use.  Obviously under his offense the Derrick Henry had 2 consecutive monster seasons as well.  Before he was their OC he was their TE coach getting the most out of Jonnu Smith and Delanie Walker.  There is a lot to like about the potential this guy brings.\n2. For OC they brought in Dave Ragone who worked with Smith on the Titans in 2011/2012/2013.  Smith was a defensive assistant/quality control coach then offensive assistant/quality control, then o-line/asst TE coach and Ragone was the WR coach then QB coach so they must have worked closely especially in that 3rd season.  From there Ragone took a season off before coming back to the NFL as an offensive quality control coach with the Redskins, followed by becoming the QB coach for the Bears from 2016-2019 and got upgraded to the passing game coordinator in 2020.  Because Matt Ryan is a completely different QB from Trubisky and widely more talented I won\u2019t try to compare and predict how the offense will run.  This especially considering Smith was a TE coach and they drafted Kyle Pitts.  As pass game coordinator they fed ARob, but that was an obvious move considering he\u2019s the most talented guy on the offense.\n3. Dean Pees also comes over from the Titans, making a lateral move as DC.  This is a great hire considering he\u2019s had success with the Patriots, Ravens, and Titans as DC before this.  However this is probably the least talented roster he\u2019ll have worked with to date so it will be a challenge.  At the very least I see some improvement coming from this hire alone.\n4. The QB coach they hired, Charles London was a RB coach tied to Ragone from his time with the Bears\u2026 again with Ragone as well as Smith in 2011 with the Titans.  I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d hire a former running back, who became a RB coach to be your QB coach but here we are.\n5. They bring in Justin Peelle fas TE coach which is important considering Pitts is going to be the 2nd receiving option on the team.  Peelle had great success as the Eagles TE coach over the years.\n6. They keep their WR coach, they hired a new OL coach who has had success at the college level and is getting his first NFL shot.  Another guy getting his first shot is their new RB coach Des Kitchings who has ascended college coaching ranks in a few different ways and is ready to make the jump.  They hired former Giants DL coach Gary Emanuel which is a solid hire considering their line has been decent. Frank Bush comes in as the LB coach and he\u2019s a great football mind to bring on.  As well as another potentially good hire at secondary coach with Jon Hoke who\u2019d been with the Bucs and the Bears before that.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. WR Julio Jones - Holy shit what a major loss to the team. It was probably the right move at the right time because of it\u2019s unavoidability but you know it still hurts. Ridley has proven he can be the guy with or without Julio and that will remain true but now the number 2 weapon is rookie TE Kyle Pitts. Let the hype train commence.  Russel Gage is going to have to step up in a way we haven\u2019t seen him do without 2 other receiving threats on the field at the same time for.\n2. RB Todd Gurley (FA) - The man\u2019s legs just aren\u2019t what they used to be and it\u2019s a damn shame.  He was still productive in the red zone but just couldn\u2019t break runs the same way.  Mike Davis is coming off of a career season backing up McCaffrey to replace Gurley here but I\u2019m not entirely certain he\u2019ll be much better especially behind that offensive line.\n3. LG James Carpenter (FA) - While he wasn\u2019t a great or even very good LG he was their starter and a veteran of the league.  At this point the only even potentially startable LG on the roster is rookie 3rd round pick Jalen Mayfield who also projected as a tackle.  \n4. S Keanu Neal - Essentially the sole bright spot of a secondary that had a lot of struggles throughout the entire season seemingly.  They also lost his counterpart at safety Ricardo Allen.  2020 4th rounder Jaylinn Hawkins will compete with Duron Harmon to the gap for Keanu.   Also Rookie second rounder Richie Grant will be in the mix.\n5. S Ricardo Allen - He struggled early in the season but got better as the year progressed and to lose him with Neal is not ideal.  To replace him they signed Erik Harris.  Also rookie second rounder Richie Grant will be in the mix.\n6. OL Justin McCray - Rotational depth that is an important loss when Carpenter could end up elsewhere.\n7. DL Allen Bailey (FA) - Rotational player on the defensive line. His loss feels more like addition by subtraction at this stage in the vet\u2019s career.\n8. QB Matt Schaub - Replaced by AJ McCarron as the backup QB.\n9. RB Ito Smith - Probably the weirdest hype train, but yeah he didn\u2019t live up to the bit of hype he carried and now he\u2019s a FA.\n10. S Damontae Kazee - Another loss to the secondary that wasn\u2019t good. He was hurt for most of the year.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. RB Mike Davis - At this point is the sole starting RB.  Qadree Ollison, 2019 5th rounder looks like his only current competition\n2. WR/RB Cordarrelle Patterson - A fantastic special teams addition and seemingly has some gadget viability.\n3. S Erik Harris - Looks like it could be a lateral move to Ricardo Allen but it\u2019s tough to know but neither were good last season is my understanding. \n4. DB Duron Harmon - Harmon has aged like a fine wine in the NFL apparently.  The true journeyman was given his first real opportunity to earn consistent snaps for the Pats in 2018, his 6th season with them.  He filled in as a starter to end the year in 2019. Then last year he was given his first opportunity to completely start with Detroit and played all 16 games.  He was above average on a very bad secondary\u2026 he\u2019ll have to be the same here if he starts.\n5. Edge Barkevious Mingo - He\u2019s rotational depth at this point in his career but ATL is thin at the position so it\u2019s a good pickup\n6. CB Fabian Moreau - Important corner depth that the team lacks\n7. LB Brandon Copeland - Important LB depth\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. TE Kyle Pitts (R1) - Looks like he\u2019s going to be the offense\u2019s number 2 weapon right out of the gate quite possibly.   Can\u2019t wait to watch fantasy owners reach way too high for him but then it still works out since he\u2019s an animal.\n2. S Richie Grant (R2) - He\u2019ll compete to earn snaps and could make a nice impact on the team\u2019s struggling secondary.\n3. OL Jalen Mayfield (R3) - Very possibly could end up starting at LG this year.\n4. C Drew Dalman (R4) - Important center depth\n5. CB Darren Hall (R4) - Important CB depth on a secondary that is putting itself together\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *I love the personnel hires, they potentially might have righted a ship that has been letting on water for the last few staffs. That being said with the players there just look to be more and more holes popping up for the players.  I think the defense remains bad for another season and the offense is incomplete and also isn\u2019t great.  That being said Ridley is still a stud and Pitts very well should be as well.  Mike Davis should be a viable RB2 on volume and Qadree Ollison is one of those true boom or bust grabs because of the potential for him to be the starter that few saw coming.  I\u2019m not a believer in Gage but I know many are.  I just don\u2019t think the o-line will be able to sustain more than Ridley on a consistent basis and I believe in Pitts over him.*\n\n#Panthers\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. Minor changes only.  The biggest change was hiring Sean Ryan to be their QB coach. Ryan was the QB coach for the Lions the last 2 seasons, the QB coach for the Texans the 2 before that, and a mix of QB or WR coach for the Giants before that. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Teddy Bridgewater - He may not have been the QB of the future for the team but he was solid despite the offense losing its\u2019 best player in CMC.  He sustained 2 1000+ yard receivers and Curtis Samuel had 851 yards on top of that.  Sam Darnold is given offensive talent for the first time in his career so we\u2019ll see how it goes as a replacement.\n2. WR Curtis Samuel - The team\u2019s WR3 but his role was so unique he won\u2019t be replaced.  He had 2 rushing TDs and over 1000 all purpose yards.  The team figured out how to use him more and more as the season went on.  To replace his production they brought in Seahawks receiver David Moore and drafted Terrence Marshall in the 2nd round.\n3. RB Mike Davis - He was handed the reigns for the first time in his career. That was done out of necessity but he stepped up in a big way for the most part.  His season tailed off but there isn\u2019t a replacement on the team so it\u2019s all McCaffrey and nobody behind him. \n4. S Tre Boston (FA) - The team\u2019s starting FS for the past 2 seasons wasn\u2019t as good as earlier in his career and they drafted Jeremy Chinn in the 2nd last season so they probably believe in him to step up this year. \n5. OT Russel Okung (FA) - Spent the last 2 seasons on and off the field for stints. The vet can\u2019t stay healthy.  Greg Little who spent the year on the IR takes his place.  They also brought in Cameron Erving and drafted Brady Christiansen in the 3rd round.\n6. DL Kawaan Short (FA) - Spent the last 2 seasons on and off the field for stints. The vet can\u2019t stay healthy.  2020 first round pick Derrick Brown filled in for his interior usage last year and a few guys rotated in for his DE usage, this year Gross-Matos the 2020 2nd rounder should handle those duties for the most part.\n7. MLB Tahir Whitehead (FA) - He outright stunk last season. He started the year as the starter and finished the year on and off of the field with injury but lost his starting spot. Denzel Perryman is going to be the one filling the hole.\n8. Edge Stephen Weatherly - After getting his first opportunity to start in his 5th season on a 1 year deal with the Panthers he leaves to return to Minnesota.  He was okay before he got hurt and finished the year on the IR.  Efe Obada and Gross-Matos filled in for him. \n9. DT/NT Zach Kerr - He was more or less package based and rotational but he was a serious run stopper. They\u2019re choosing youth to fill the role.\n10. LG Chris Reed - The veteran got his first go at starting and did decently.  There will be a competition to fill the hole but they may have to protect whoever comes into that spot.\n\n11. Edge Efe Obada -Rotational depth.\n\n12. FB Alex Armah - They brought in a UDFA Mason Stokke to fill the role.  Stokke was a LB and switched to FB in 2018 so he\u2019s not as experienced but he has the physical prowess.  We\u2019ll see if he makes the 53.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Sam Darnold - I was a big believer in Darnold when he was drafted out of college but I think at this point he\u2019s shown he isn\u2019t going to be the QB of the future.  As a stop-gap QB let\u2019s try to anticipate what we can expect out of Darnold.  We did see a small boost for Tannehill post-Gase and a very significant bump when he left Miami.  I just worry that we haven\u2019t seen enough attributes or traits out of Darnold in comparison to Tannehill that we knew had tools but never put it together.  Either way he has a 1/2 punch that he was never even close to with the Jets in CMC with DJ Moore and Robby Anderson.  Speaking of Robby Anderson he\u2019s reunited with Darnold so you have an instant connection there but talent always wins out so look to DJ Moore to continue his trend of taking over as the season progresses.  I won\u2019t delve into fit because it\u2019s always night and day from with Gase to without him.\n2. Edge/LB Haason Reddick - Came into his own in his 4th season, the versatile player joins some flash and youth. I think this is a very nice addition if he fits in.\n3. OT/OG Cameron Erving - He struggled with injury last year but the now journeyman will have an opportunity to earn more snaps on the Panthers line who has talent but also holes to fill.\n4. WR David Moore - He\u2019s replacing Curtis Samuel as the WR3 and will have competition with rookie Terrance Marshall Jr. but his experience should be valuable to the offense as a safety net.  He likely won\u2019t be viable as a fantasy player though.\n5. OG/C Pat Elflein - He got hurt early in the season but played every snap of the games he played to finish the year out with the Jets.  That familiarity with Darnold could be helpful but he really wasn\u2019t good but none of the line was\u2026 He\u2019ll compete for snaps/to start.\n6. DL DaQuan Jones - A super nice pickup to the front 7. If they find the right way to use him he\u2019s instantly going to make an impact in the trenches.\n7. CB AJ Bouye - He wasn\u2019t as good in Denver as they\u2019d hoped, getting hurt doesn\u2019t help that but now he won\u2019t have as many responsibilities even if he earns the starting spot and that\u2019s where he really shines.\n8. DL Morgan Fox - Important depth. He could prove to be better than expected just because he was overshadowed by the Rams study d line\u2026 or he could just not be good enough, which is why they brought others in.\n9. TE Dan Arnold - I speak for DHop owners everywhere that this dude was a low-key vulture last season in the worst way because you never saw it coming.  He\u2019s just a good TE and will force Ian Thomas to prove himself.\n10. LB Denzel Perryman - Not a very great pickup but they had to get an inside linebacker one way or another.\n11. CB Rashaan Melvin - He opted out of the 2020 season and joins his former teammate AJ Bouye and will have to earn snaps in what really looks like a deep cornerback unit.\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. CB Jaycee Horn (R1) - Joins a secondary that has potential next season. He\u2019ll have to earn snaps to prove himself but is in a good situation once he does.\n2. WR Terrence Marshall Jr. (R2) - I don\u2019t think he\u2019s super NFL ready but I could be wrong.  He\u2019s a big receiver with good hands but needs to work on his route running. He could have some surprise deep balls in mid season once he learns the offense but before teams figure him out.\n3. OL Brady Christiansen (R3) - Very important depth and lots of opportunity for snaps on the team so he could earn some.\n4. TE Tommy Tremble (R3) - Will be buried behind Ian Thomas and Dan Arnold this season at least.\n5. RB Chuba Hubbard (R4) - He comes in as a change of pace back. He is more of a home run RB and not as many tools in his shed as CMC (but that\u2019s true for most).  He could earn some touches to prevent CMC from having too much wear and tear but I\u2019m not sure about him overall.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team**\n\n**Assessment** *The personnel are in year 2 and I think ownership is cautiously optimistic on their hires. The team lost a key piece in Curtis Samuel but filled A LOT of holes elsewhere. They focused on the DL, the OL, and the secondary and I think they did a decent job. What matters the most is that it all rests on Darnold shoulders. What is his ceiling? How long will it take him to find it?  I obviously will trust CMC this season and assume he\u2019ll stay healthy.  I also believe in DJ Moore to be a viable player. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be reaching to draft him at all.  Robby Anderson you have to figure will put up consistent numbers and be a safe flex or WR2 play.  The TE position is a tough one to assume a lot of strength but it\u2019s tough to assume with a new QB.*\n\n#Saints\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1.  They lost their QB coach and their defensive back coach to other teams but it primarily stayed the same overall with some shuffling of titles and support positions.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Drew Brees (Retired) - The legend moves on to greener pastures and now it\u2019s up to Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill to fill the void. An impossible challenge for either but we\u2019ve seen some successes with both in some capacity.  The general belief is that it has to be Jameis for the most part but it\u2019s tough to know for sure with Sean Payton.\n2. Edge Trey Hendrickson - He got his first endorsement as a starter and he stepped up in a big way to break out. Marcus Davenport started there the year prior and will be back there this season presumably.  They also drafted Peyton Turner in the 1st round (In anticipation of Cam Jordan aging out soon).\n3. WR Emmanuel Sanders - He probably expected to play with Brees for the most part but he also expected to be the team\u2019s WR2.  With both Brees and Thomas both missing significant time last season (Kamara missing some time too). He was good but not great and that\u2019s fair. There really isn\u2019t a replacement to fill the WR2 void so again it all falls on Thomas and Kamara to lead the way\u2026. With nobody behind them at all.\n4. CB Janoris Jenkins - The veteran CB still played well last season and moved on to the Titans. They drafted Adebo Paulson in the 3rd round and have Patrick Robinson to fill the gap which is definitely going to be a step down.\n5. DL Malcom Brown - This is an actually pretty tough loss to the front 7.  He was good for the patriots for 4 seasons then was good for the saints the last 2 seasons. He doesn\u2019t really have a replacement but you can figure they\u2019ll change up the scheme to match the players.\n6. OL Nick Easton - He was drafted as a center but started as a guard in 15 of the 22 games played for the saints in the last 2 seasons. Cesar Ruiz, 2020 first round pick will fill in nicely presumably.\n7. TE Jared Cook - Normally losing a 34 year old TE wouldn\u2019t be a significant loss but without Sanders the offense is very obviously locked in with MT and Kamara as their 2 main weapons and Taysom Hill as a gadget.  He\u2019s replaced by Nick Vannett\n8. LB Kwon Alexander - The Saints traded for him mid-season and he was below average but okay for them on a rotational basis. \n9. P Thomas Morstead - While he didn\u2019t have the greatest leg, he knew the special teams system well.  He was towards the bottom in punt yards but was top 10 in net yards.  The signed former UDFA Blake Gillikin who was pretty good for Penn State but there were a decent number of punters with a better avg.\n10. TE Josh Hill - We know he isn\u2019t going to be a receiving threat but this is a case of without Cook this loss is more relevant.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. TE Nick Vannett - I suppose he\u2019ll be their receiving TE but my expectations aren\u2019t exactly high.\n2. Edge Tanoh Kpassagnon - He\u2019ll be a nice rotational player on the d line which needed a depth piece.\n3. FB Alex Armah - This is actually really nice for Kamara\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. DE Payton Turner (R1) - A good pickup for the future of their pass rush and doesn\u2019t have to start out of the gate but can compete for snaps.\n2. LB Pete Werner (R2) - A versatile LB with coverage abilities will come in and potentially be their starting Sam and very well could be.  It\u2019s a hole that needs to be filled.\n3. CB Adebo Paulson (R3) - A pick for the future that could also compete for snaps right away.\n4. QB Ian Book (R4) - A shot in the dark for a more conventional backup QB\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *I do like Winston and am a bit of a believer in him.  I think he has the talent to succeed with the coaching that is in place in NO. HOWEVER, he only has 2 weapons on the offense and a weird thing going on where Taysom Hill very well could be the starter.  Essentially the offense did well enough to sustain Kamara without Brees last year so you can assume he\u2019s a safe bet if he\u2019s healthy. Then Michael Thomas is a stud so you can assume he\u2019ll help carry whomever is the QB.  After that it would be a surprise if any of the depth guys emerge as viable fantasy targets.  TreQuan Smith should be the number 2 but I don\u2019t figure he\u2019ll be able to sustain much.  The FB signing is a big indicator of what the teams ants to do.  On the defensive side of the ball I expect a decent drop-off from the progress made in the last 2 seasons.  They did invest in the draft for the future but I don\u2019t see this year being the year that those investments pay off.* \n\n#Buccaneers\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. No significant changes at all.  The SB champs tried to keep everyone and they did for the most part.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. OL Joe Haeg - A rotational depth lineman. When this is your worst loss to your SB winning team that\u2019s a very good thing.\n2. OL AQ Shipley - Another rotational depth lineman\u2026 that\u2019s it that\u2019s everyone of even relative significance.  LeSean McCoy had 132 scrimmage yards in 10 games would be the next most relevant drop.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. Gio Bernard - Comes in to fill the void left by McCoy which isn\u2019t a significant one.  I think he fills a need in a very good way as a pass catching back. Fournette was their 3rd down back last season and had enough drops that this move is actually really nice.  It\u2019s the only one of significance that they made and it makes sense.\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. OLB/Edge Joe Tryon (R1) - A great addition to rotate in behind JPP and earn some snaps.\n2. QB Kyle Track (R2) - Could be the QB of the future, could be a bust but Brady was cool with it so nothing to worry about.\n3. OL Robert Hainsey (R3) - Nice OL depth\n4. WR Jaelon Darden (R4) - He won\u2019t see the field any time soon outside of maybe special teams since he\u2019s behind Evans/Godwin/AB/Scotty Miller but he\u2019s more of a gadget speedster so his skillset is different from them. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *See: 2020 Buccaneers.  Apparently Brady didn\u2019t even have the playbook down until closer to week 10 so.  That\u2019s when Mike Evans turned it up in a big way despite playing through some injuries (as he usually does).  It\u2019s also when AB joined the team.  I\u2019ll be curious to see how everything plays out in terms of touches between the 3 receivers and Gronk after a full offseason with the playbook.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes AFC South", "created": 1628554429.0, "players": ["Drew Brees", "Jared Cook", "LeSean McCoy", "Matt Ryan", "Matt Schaub", "Emmanuel Sanders", "Julio Jones", "Allen Bailey", "Patrick Robinson", "Janoris Jenkins", "Tahir Whitehead", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Barkevious Mingo", "Duron Harmon", "Rashaan Melvin", "Teddy Bridgewater", "AJ McCarron", "Mike Evans", "DaQuan Jones", "Tre Boston", "Ricardo Allen", "Michael Thomas", "Zach Kerr", "Brandon Copeland", "Josh Hill", "Jameis Winston", "Mike Davis", "Malcom Brown", "Denzel Perryman", "Kwon Alexander", "Efe Obada", "Derrick Henry", "Michael Thomas", "Keanu Neal", "Erik Harris", "Nick Vannett", "Robby Anderson", "Stephen Weatherly", "Morgan Fox", "Corey Davis", "Haason Reddick", "Curtis Samuel", "Jonnu Smith", "Tanoh Kpassagnon", "Fabian Moreau", "Damontae Kazee", "Alex Armah", "Trey Hendrickson", "David Moore", "Taysom Hill", "Dan Arnold", "Sam Darnold", "Ito Smith", "Marcus Davenport", "Ian Thomas", "Qadree Ollison", "Scotty Miller", "Derrick Brown", "Richie Grant", "Jeremy Chinn", "Jaylinn Hawkins", "Chuba Hubbard", "Ian Book", "Kyle Pitts", "Dave Ragone", "Jaycee Horn", "Joe Tryon", "Payton Turner", "Tommy Tremble", "Jaelon Darden", "Pete Werner", "Darren Hall", "Mason Stokke"]}, {"author": "slivr33", "created_utc": 1628532551, "id": "p16ysr", "score": 1, "selftext": "I was mostly doing it for myself in draft prep but figured I could dress it up a bit and send it to you guys.

Nagy returns for what looks to be a make or break year for him.  Lazor gets a second shot at OC, and a big one with Fields/Dalton as QB. DC Chuck Pagano retired and they promoted safeties coach Sean Desai to DC.  \n2. The rest of mentionables: They hired Michael Pitre to be their RB coach. Michael Was the RB coach/lead recruiter for the Oregon Ducks.  Chris Rumph comes in as D line coach after a nice college career and broke into the NFL coaching ranks last year with the Texans.  A few other minor promotions from within etc.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Mitch Trubisky - Mitch Titties is gone and the ~~Andy Dalton~~ Justin Fields era begins.  We\u2019ll see how quickly Fields starts for the Bears. In the meantime Dalton can keep them afloat.\n2. CB Kyle Fuller - Coming off of a bad season by his standards but he is a tough loss to this secondary as he takes a lot of responsibility on. Replacing him is Desmond Trufant and uhh I\u2019m not sure which is very\u2026. Very not good.\n3. LT Charles Leno Jr. - A consistent starter that helped steady this line for years.  He\u2019s not an elite LT but he is definitely a good one.  Rookie 2nd rounder Teven Jenkins has big shoes to fill.\n4. DB Buster Skrine - More of a fill-in/depth guy but in conjunction with Fuller\u2019s departure this looks worse.\n5. WR/KR/PR Cordarrelle Patterson - A much bigger loss than people will give credit as he\u2019s a top 5 special teamer in the league and field position matters big time.\n6. RT Bobbie Massie - Spent the ends of both of the last 2 seasons hurt but hone he was on the field he was pretty good, he\u2019s 32 now so I get letting him go but important depth being missed when Leno Jr. leaves is tough.\n7. OG Rashad Coward - More important depth that had starts last season that\u2019s departing.  He\u2019s young though.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Andy Dalton - Shroedinger\u2019s QB, simultaneously average, unreliable, steady, and can win games.  Came in to be the starter until Fields dropped low enough for the bears to go up and get him. He\u2019ll be on a short leash if he starts the season and both he and Fields give Robinson a big bump, and I see Mooney as a stash until Fields is in.  Indirectly they both help out Montgomery since he will have some amount of less focus with Dalton and more volume initially then less focus if Fields is good.\n2. Edge Jeremiah Attachou - Some nice athletic LB depth\n3. DL Angelo Blackson - Very nice DL depth addition, he fits the role of rotational at best and that\u2019s exactly what the depth chart needs.\n4. LB Christian Jones. -  Another depth addition that was a starter but shouldn\u2019t be\n5. RB Damien Williams - He\u2019s not touching David Montgomery or Cohen\u2019s snaps so he\u2019s purely depth.\n6. WR Marquis Goodwin - The guy had a breakout season in 2017 then got hurt in 2018 and 2019 then opted out for covid.  The speedster will be behind Mooney presumably in his role.\n7. TE Jesse James - He\u2019ll push Kmet for snaps.\"\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. QB Justin Fields (R1) - He joins a team that just signed Dalton for 3 seasons but who knows how that\u2019ll play out.  Surely this kid will start with the way the league works today.  If/When that happens let\u2019s look at what we can try to expect.  Fields\u2019 had a plethora of different plays he excelled at in Ryan Day\u2019s offense at OSU. My understanding is that they did A LOT of repetition of a lot of different types of plays that would work at the college level.  There wasn\u2019t a heavy emphasis on one or two things like Lawrence. So being familiar with a plethora of plays is good, being able to study/learn and execute many different types of plays is definitely important, the big question is how much will the jump to the NFL affect him specifically?  While I\u2019m a believer in Fields long term success, I don\u2019t know if I fully believe he\u2019ll make the transition smoothly. We\u2019ll see though.  It\u2019s also worth noting that Nagy and Lazor employed different offenses for Trubisky and Foles so again it\u2019s hard to assume what to expect the offense with Fields to look like.  Fields had a connection with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson in 2020.  Olave is a typical Z receiver and very good route runner with decent size. Wilson was more or less a slot receiver that played outside as well. He also has decent size.  In 2019 he worked well with Olave as his primary target, but also BInjimen Victor the big target and KJ Hill an underneath route runner.  At Georgia he spread it out more or less and also had a connection with the TE. \n2. OT Teven Jenkins (R2) - Will have a lot of responsibility as a rookie but is scouted as NFL ready.  He\u2019ll be a boost to Montgomery I believe.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT/NT Eddie Goldman - He started for the Bears in the 5 seasons prior (with 1 injured season cut short) and his return will ensure their depth at the position and give them run d versatility in their schemes. \n\n**Assessment** *Well it\u2019s tough to really know what to expect out of the offense considering Lazor and Nagy are probably trying to custom fit one for each QB and haven\u2019t exactly had real success offensively.  Frankly I can\u2019t be sure we can trust them to produce an a great offense.  Either way we have plenty to be excited about because ARob and Montgomery immediately get upticks regardless of which QB starts the season because both are better than what they had last year. Mooney who showed a lot of flash in his rookie season has real potential for a sophomore breakout as well, I really like him if Fields gets in but I don\u2019t expect it right out of the gate.  Jimmy Graham probably remains the same tier 3 TD dependent TE at this stage in his career.  The defense remains very good as well but the secondary isn\u2019t as good as last season without Fuller.*\n\n#Lions\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. They fired Patricia (with good reason) and hired Dan Campbell, a character in his own right with a big time emphasis on toughness.  He was a tight end as a player and his history is as a TE coach (Hockenson giving me a hard-on). From 2011-2015 he was the Dolphins TE coach.  He worked with Fasano, Clay, and Jordan Cameron. Fasano was past his peak but hit his career high 5 TD seasons both of the years working with Campbell.  He notably coached Charles Clay to his 759 yard 6 TD season., as well as Clay\u2019s other decent year. Jordan Cameron wasn\u2019t really a talent and was phased out of the offense.  In 2015 he served as the interim head coach of the Dolphins when they fired Philbin after week 4.  The team went 5-7 while featuring Jarvis Landry as the main cog in the offense. Lamar Miller had a down season compared to the rest of the peak of his career.  Tannehill had a career high in yards with a good TD/INT ratio.  Parker and Ajayi were rookies supporting the offense along with Kenny Stills who failed to meet expectations after his time with the Saints. Instead Rishard Matthews had a bit of a breakout.  From there he went to the Saints as TE coach/Asst head coach from 2016 through 2020.  Unfortunately in that time frame he wasn\u2019t given too much top end talent at the TE position in that time frame.  Coby Fleener finished his career with NO, Ben Watson returned to NO, Josh Hill well\u2026 we don\u2019t talk about that, then more recently Taysom Hill but he barely lined up as TE, and last year he worked with 33 year old Jared Cook.  So here we are with a man likely licking his lips at the opportunity to work with top end talent in their prime with Hockenson.  He seems like he\u2019ll be a good coach and he said along the lines of how some coaches don\u2019t like hiring people who could end up replacing them but he didn\u2019t care he wanted to surround himself with as much talent and knowledge as possible and he did.\n2. He brought in Anthony Lynn who was the HC of the the last few seasons. Lynn was not a good head coach for a few reasons but he did lead the chargers to a 12-4 season in 2018 and had shown the other reasons in which he was hired for.  Before his time with the Chargers he was tied to Rex Ryan with the Jets and Bills as the RB coach and assistant head coach, he also was a RB coach for the Browns and Cowboys even before that.  This is probably a factor as to why the Chargers running backs were so solid through his tenure there.  A simplified take on how he did throughout all of those jobs is that when he left the run game always took a dive at all of those places.  It\u2019s also noteworthy that he helped the RBs on his teams find some of their more successful seasons.  You have to figure he\u2019ll place a heavy emphasis on a balanced offense and therefore I expect Swift to have some really nice numbers this season with Jamaal Williams as nice support.  The Chargers offenses also supported a number 1 receiver every year with viable number 2 in most seasons between Tyrell and Mike Williams successes\u2026 however the offenses had real talent and Whisenhunt was likely the mind behind the offenses and last year Steichen.\n3. For DC the team hired Aaron Glenn who had served as the Saints secondary coach for the past 4 seasons and their DB coach the season before that.   I\u2019m not entirely sure I get this one as the Saints had one of the worst secondaries throughout most of that tenure.  The key positive takeaway is that the Saints invested draft capital and traded for players in the secondary and he coached them up from being very bad to better.\n4. Back to the offensive side of the ball, the team also brings in Duce Staley to be Asst Head coach/RB Coach.  Staley has been with the Eagles organization since his coaching career started and became the RB coach in 2013, getting a bump in job title adding Asst Head Coach in 2018.  That 2013 season was McCoy\u2019s monster of a year with another nice one in 2014. After that he was given very little talent to work with in Demarco Murray and Ryan Matthews at the end of their careers, Blount, Josh Adams, until rookie Miles Sanders was decent.   Of course Sproles was around in support as well as Clement and Scott\u2026 those 3 guys are why I\u2019m excited for him to work with Swift as a similar player (and very much not like him as a player hah)\n5. Mark Brunell comes in as the QB coach. It\u2019s his first shot as a coach at the NFL level.  He\u2019s been the head coach at Episcopal School of Jacksonville, a prep school, for the last 8 years.\n6. Antwaan Randel El also joins the staff as the WR coach. He served as an offensive assistant coach to Bruce Arians the last 2 seasons.  \n7. They bring over a new Special Teams Coordinator, a new DB/D Pass game coordinator, and a few others on the d side of the ball. They retain their TE coach with good reason.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Matt Stafford - It\u2019ll be weird to see Goff in at QB in Stafford\u2019s wake.  Stafford had a 4000 yard season despite Golladay being injured most fo the year. He spread it to Jones, Hockenson, Amendola, and a bunch of others to get there.  \n2. WR Kenny Golladay - Missed a ton of time injured last season but the guy is a stud when healthy.  His departure along with Marvin Jones will be a serious gap to fill for Tyrell Williams (hurt last season), Brashad Perriman, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.\n3. WR Marvin Jones - Jones was the number 1 producer in the pass game last season and showed he still has game.  On his own his departure hurts but with Golladay being traded this is a really tough loss.\n4. S Duran Harmon - Starting safety that was decent considering how bad the lions secondary was in general.  I\u2019m not sure who they intend on filling that hole with.\n5. LB Christian Jones - Starting outside linebacker that had his struggles last year but losing a starter without a defined replacement isn\u2019t fun\n6. DT Danny Shelton - They lost him but they brought in what very much should be an upgrade to his last season\u2019s performance Michael Brockers who at 31 is going to have to prove he can do it on a DL without Aaron Donald.\n7. RB Adrian Peterson - It\u2019s Swift\u2019s backfield now and that\u2019s a good thing!\n8. TE Jesse James (FA) - Typically not worth mentioning but he\u2019s in here because his replacement is Darren Fells whom I like a lot as an improvement in the pass game.  I expect some 2 TE sets with him and Hockenson considering their WR depth.\n9. MLB Jarrad Davis - Lost his starting spot but still contributed\n10. Danny Amendola (FA) - On its own isn\u2019t a bad loss but again this is a guy who contributed to the pass game and is now gone.\n11. K Matt Prater - Prater\u2019s best days might be behind him considering his fg% was around 75% last season so this loss isn\u2019t a bad one.  However Randy Bullock isn\u2019t much better and lacks Prater\u2019s range, even in a dome. \n12. OL/OG Joe Dahl - Important offensive line depth that started 13 games in 2019\n13. OL/OG Oday Aboushi - Important offensive line depth that started 8 games last season\n14. DB Justin Coleman - Important secondary depth but on a bad secondary so he\u2019s replaceable but who are they replacing him with?  His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill.\n15. DB Darryl Roberts - Important secondary depth that started 5 games last season.   His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill as well.\n16. RB Kerryon Johnson -  See: Adrian Peterson\n17. CB Desmond Trufant - The vet was injured most of last year and struggled when healthy.\n18. LB Reggie Ragland - Important depth at the LB psoition, on its own it\u2019s ok but another case where someone else\u2019s departure it hurts more. The other in this instance being Christian Jones.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Jared Goff - Only time will tell if this move was the right one for the Lions. While Stafford is better and Goff has a serious cap hit getting two firsts and a 3rd in the deal makes it seemingly more than worth it.  This especially considering Goff has had success in the NFL, the question is how much of the success was his and how much was the system.  Either way Goff is coming over to a team without a true number 1 receiver.  They have Tyrell Williams coming off of a season on the IR with a shoulder injury and never proved he could be a WR1.  Brashad Perriman who presumably maxes out as a WR2, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.  That is a big step down from Kupp/Woods/Reynolds and previously Cooks.  So you have to figure Hockenson is going to have to be a huge factor for this offense to move.  \n2. DT/DL Michael Brockers - The vet comes in and instantly is a nice addition to the d line. His success has been next to Aaron Donald though so take it with a grain of salt since his responsibility is to hold it down while Donald tears it up.  The team doesn\u2019t have anyone like Donald but they did invest a 2nd and a 3rd round pick to the DL.\n3. WR Tyrell Williams - He\u2019s getting another shot at being a number 1 receiver after a disappointing 2019 and sat out 2020 with an injury.  He\u2019s got the freshlegs but who even knows what to expect.\n4. Jamaal Williams - Joins an offense that will have to have a heavy emphasis on the run and he has proven he can be a 1B. In this instance he\u2019s not going to be a 1B but more a complimentary back since he and Swift are very different runners.  If the run game is good in general he\u2019ll be a top tier handcuff.\n5. WR Breshad Perriman - After a disappointing start to his career he\u2019s proven he can be an NFL receiver in some capacity but he probably maxes out as a WR2.  His addition is important to a team thin an WR talent. \n6. TE Darren Fells - I kind of love this pickup - it\u2019s a subtle addition that could mean a lot to the offensive playbook as he has decent hands and is an okay route runner.  I\u2019m bullish in saying that I see him as a TE handcuff that has some production of his own the way Boyle was for Fleener on the Andrew Luck Colts offense.\n7. LB Alex Anzalone - The angel haired inside LB joins a team that needs depth and fills in nicely hopefully. \n8. QB Tim Boyle - He replaces Chase Daniel as the backup QB. I\u2019m not sure why they paid him as much as they did as the backup but hey he\u2019s a backup QB.\n9. K Randy Bullock - Maybe an upgrade to Prater in accuracy, not by much though, definitely doesn\u2019t have the power of Prater\u2026 but he\u2019s an NFL kicker.\n10. CB Quinten Dunbar - Much needed CB depth, he\u2019s dealt with injuries recently\n11. S Dean Marlowe - Purely depth with no startability upside but they NEED it in the secondary.\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OG Penei Sewell (R1) - Tough to say you found a deal at the 4th overall pick but the Lions thought they got one at that spot and they just might have.  This guy is going to pave the way for what clearly will be an offense that relies on the run.\n2. DT Levi Nowuzurike (R2) A much needed addition to the D line.  Figure he\u2019ll compete to start out of the gate\n3. DT Alim McNeill (R3) - Some competition on this D line for snaps will probably be a good thing.  It\u2019s clear what the staff want to do in bulking up in the trenches (Eagles model)\n4. CB Ifeatu Melifonwu (R3) - Much needed addition to the secondary. He could compete for snaps out of the get go.\n5. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (R4) - I think he plays like a slightly shorter/weaker Keenan Allen as he\u2019s shifty but his quickness is more a product of his ability to see/find space mores than his feet.  He very well could have an immediate impact on this offense since there isn\u2019t probowl talent in front of him. Not to mention his amazing name makes for great fantasy team names. He\u2019s a dynasty target for sure.\n6. LB Derrick Barnes (R4) - Another guy who might just compete for snaps from day 1.  I figure he\u2019ll be rotational but could earn it in the tail. End of the season.\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Geronimo Allison - Wouldn\u2019t be mentioned if they still had Golladay but yeah I feel like he has a shot to make an impact considering the rest of the names in that WR room.\n\n**Assessment** *Here\u2019s what I can say with confidence.  BIG buy on Hockenson with the value of TE in fantasy, and definitely invest in Deandre Swift.  After that I\u2019m really not sure what to say here.  The team\u2019s defense was bottom tier in 2020 and lost a lot of players that they didn\u2019t replace.. a lot think it\u2019s addition by subtraction and I can buy that considering they did add to the line but we\u2019ll see.  All eyes on Goff but the offense can\u2019t be totally inept outside of Hockenson and the run game.  Jamaal Williams is a great handcuff to own.  Amon-Ra probably won\u2019t be viable until later in the season in redraft leagues.  Tyrell Williams and Brashad Perriman are bust/boom drafts more than boom/bust.  Goff is in for a challenge this season.*\n\n#Packers\n\n- **Personnel**  \n\n1. Lafleaur and Hackett remain HC and OC and there\u2019s no reason to think they shouldn\u2019t be.  Mike Pettine was not brought back as DC after he brought them from pretty bad to pretty decent.  They hired Joe Barry who was assistant head coach/linebackers coach of the Rams from 2017-2020. Before that he was the Redskins DC.  He also had a 2 year stint as the Lions DC that ended abruptly after their 0-16 season.  Anyways his last stint as DC with the Redskins he did well enough.  He brought them from the bottom of the league to the middle in terms of defensive statistics for the 2 seasons he was there.  His time with the Rams is tough to gauge as an assistant head coach/LB coach but obviously he did at least okay.\n2. The rest are essentially some job title improvements and responsibility distribution amongst the staff that was already in place.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Aaron Rodgers - DEFINITELY PRE-EMPTIVE but if the guy is going pretty much not going to be your starting QB he\u2019s essentially gone.  Things could change but we\u2019ll see. If Rodgers doesn\u2019t play for the Packers I expect the offense and the team to fall apart fairly quickly.  Davante is still going to produce no matter who\u2019s throwing the ball but after that I expect a serious hit to Aaron Jones when the pass threat isn\u2019t as deadly.  Even if the volume is greater the quality is likely too much of a drop-off unless Jordan Love turns out to be as good of a rookie as say Herbert was last season.\n2. C Corey Linsley - The stud center signed with the Chargers.  2019 2nd rounder Elgton Jenkins will compete with 2021 2nd rounder Josh Myers for the job.  By default they will be a downgrade at least this season.\n3. RT Ricky Wagner (FA) - The veteran was released despite starting 9 games fairly well last season.  He did split snaps throughout the year though.  Billy Turner is getting the endorsement to step up for the position next season. Which is fine.\n4. RB Jamaal Williams - He steadily helped the offense tick throughout all 4 seasons. He never achieved the goal of being a starter but he was top tier as a 1B.  I do believe AJ Dillon will be more than capable of filling his shoes. If Rodgers is their QB I actually have Dillon as having a potential to steal starting reps from Jones.\n5. ILB Christian Kirksey - Starting LB who doesn\u2019t have a clear cut replacement so his loss will be felt a little.. however he wasn\u2019t very good last season so next man up.\n6.  QB Tim Boyle - Actually not a good loss considering the current shenanigans\u2026 however Blake muthafuckin Bortles signed with the Packers so that\u2019s a nice step up for their 3rd QB who very well could be their 2nd.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Blake Bortles - That\u2019s it. He\u2019s literally the only free agent they signed from outside the organization.  It\u2019s a good signing and it\u2019s probably due to cap issues.  He\u2019s a good signing but they have holes to fill. \n- **Relavant Draft**\n1. CB Eric Stokes (R1) - He\u2019ll push Kevin King for a starting position opposite of Jaire Alexander.\n2. C Josh Myers (R2) - He\u2019ll compete with Elgton Jenkins to start.\n3. WR Amari Rodgers (R3) - Likely an instant starter and an automatic late round flier if Rodgers plays for the Packers this season.\n4. RT Royce Newman (R4) - Good depth at a position that needed depth\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Devin Funchess - I guess relevant but probably not\n**Assessment** *It all rides on Rodgers, plain and simple.  If he plays then buy high on Davante, at value for Aaron Jones, definitely take shots on AJ Dillon and Amari Rodgers. If Aaron doesn\u2019t play then well\u2026 just Davante at what his new value would be and Aaron Jones if he falls.*\n\n#Vikings\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. A bunch of promotion and shuffling from within happened. However there is one important note.  Gary Kubiak retired and his son Klint is now the Offensive Coordinator.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything worth taking away from that.  Maybe someone who\u2019s a diehard vikings fan and goes to training camp can weigh in on what to expect different from Gary. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. LT Riley Reiff - A veteran of the game and still is an NFL starter but his prime was a few years ago.  They drafted Christian Darrisaw in the first round to replace him.\n2. S/DB Anthony Harris - He wasn\u2019t a standout but definitely a piece to the puzzle for the secondary.  His replacement being Xavier Woods could be a step down but Xavier was probably the best piece of the Cowboys secondary and he\u2019s joining a team that has more pieces around him.\n3. LB Eric Wilson - Another starter lost on the defensive side but Wilson left fans wanting more considering Anthony Barr is the guy he was filling in for.  Barr returns from the IR this year to start again, but how much time does he have left?\n4. DE/Edge Ifeadi Odenigbo - He also got his first shot as a starter in the NFL and disappointed last season. They brought in Stephen Weatherly to help fill the hole but they also drafted guys in the 3rd/4th this year and DJ Wonnum in the 4th last year so it\u2019ll be a bit of a competition.\n5. DT Shamar Stephen - He started 15 and 16 games for the Vikings the last 2 seasons.  Like Harris he wasn\u2019t a standout but he was a piece to the puzzle.  However they have Michael Pierce returning from the Covid Opt Out list to step up.\n6. K Dan Bailey - He had one of the worst FG% in the league and so the team moved on from him.  South African Greg Joseph is competing with UDFA Riley Patterson for the position.\n7. DT Jaleel Johnson - Another starter lost. This one however is probably more of a case of addition by subtraction\u2026. Also the fact that they brought in Dalvin Tomlinson to fill the hole is a HUGE improvement\n8. QB Sean Mannion - Kellen Mond\u2019s arrival meant Mannion was out as the backup QB.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. DT Dalvin Tomlinson - A big time pickup for the front 7.  Him with Pierce will help stabilize the heart of the D to give it the opportunity return to their former success.\n2. CB Patrick Peterson - The veteran still has talent and his addition also helps the defensive side of the ball.\n3. DL Sheldon Richardson - Another very nice addition to the front 7 to help the Vikings recapture the image they once had.\n4. CB Bashaud Breeland - a decent pickup for their secondary.\n5. S Xavier Woods -  As with many in the Cowboys secondary he had his struggles but he did show ability and he joins a defense with more pieces around him so I expect a nice improvement to both the front 7 and the secondary next season.\n6. WR Dede Westbrook - I think he has a good chance to compete for the 3rd receiver spot behind Theilen and JJ.\n7. Edge Stephen Weatherly - He got his first opportunity to be the starter and wasn\u2019t exactly what the Panthers were looking for statistically and he finished the season on the IR. He\u2019s in competition with some young guns for the starting spot.\n8. LB Nick Vigil - Important depth behind Barr.\n9. CB Mackensie Alexander - Important depth\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OT Christian Darrisaw (R1) - A day 1 starter at LT will have some growing pains but he\u2019s very talented.  Reiff\u2019s replacement has big shoes to fill.\n2. OG Wyatt Davis (R3) - He won\u2019t have to start out of the gate but could earn snaps\n3. QB Kellen Mond (R3) - I like him as a backup with potential in the future\n4. DE Patrick Jones II (R3) - Will compete to start this season\n5. MLB Chazz Surrat (R3) - Important depth behind Kendricks\n6. DE Janarius Robinson (R4) - Will compete to start the season\n7. S Camryn Bynum (R4) - Important depth behind Xavier Woods\n8. RB Kene Nwangwu (R4) - I think this was a draft based on measurables. He\u2019ll have 2 seasons to develop behind Cook and Mattison when Mattison will become a FA.\n9. TE Zach Davidson (R5) - He could end up being a receiving threat down the line but he isn\u2019t built to be an NFL TE yet. He has height but not functional strength/size. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT Michael Pierce - It was tough for the team not to have him available last season after bringing him in to steady the line but this year having him around along with Tomlinson will be huge, literally.\n\n**Assessment** *The team obviously focused on their defense in a big way but also their O line.  The main thing to focus on is Klint Kubiak and what that means for the offense. He\u2019ll need to command the same respect as his father.  Regardless it\u2019ll be safe to assume nice season from Cook, Theilen, and Jefferson. They don\u2019t really have a TE for the sake of moving the ball so it\u2019s those 3 alone that will be the workhorses as they have been.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes NFC North", "created": 1628554151.0, "players": ["Aaron Rodgers", "Adrian Peterson", "Chase Daniel", "Danny Amendola", "Jared Cook", "Matt Prater", "Jimmy Graham", "Patrick Peterson", "Andy Dalton", "Buster Skrine", "Dan Bailey", "Lamar Miller", "Michael Brockers", "Randy Bullock", "Kenny Stills", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Keenan Allen", "Sheldon Richardson", "Desmond Trufant", "Blake Bortles", "Jarvis Landry", "Anthony Barr", "Christian Jones", "Aaron Donald", "Kyle Fuller", "Christian Kirksey", "Bashaud Breeland", "Shamar Stephen", "Damien Williams", "Josh Hill", "Darren Fells", "Danny Shelton", "Eddie Goldman", "Devin Funchess", "Sean Mannion", "Jesse James", "Breshad Perriman", "Darryl Roberts", "Angelo Blackson", "Dean Marlowe", "Tyrell Williams", "Justin Coleman", "Anthony Harris", "Jared Goff", "Mackensie Alexander", "Reggie Ragland", "Nick Vigil", "Geronimo Allison", "Stephen Weatherly", "Michael Pierce", "Mike Williams", "Jamaal Williams", "Dede Westbrook", "Jarrad Davis", "Kevin King", "Kenny Golladay", "Xavier Woods", "Dalvin Tomlinson", "Aaron Jones", "Ifeadi Odenigbo", "Jaleel Johnson", "Eric Wilson", "Alex Anzalone", "Taysom Hill", "Kerryon Johnson", "Josh Adams", "Christian Kirk", "Jaire Alexander", "Greg Joseph", "Tim Boyle", "David Montgomery", "Miles Sanders", "Jordan Love", "AJ Dillon", "Kellen Mond", "Janarius Robinson", "Binjimen Victor", "Justin Fields", "Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Chris Olave", "Amari Rodgers", "Dan Campbell", "Marvin Jones", "Duce Staley", "Aaron Glenn", "Mike Williams", "Patrick Jones II", "Eric Stokes", "Camryn Bynum", "Alim McNeill", "Ifeatu Melifonwu", "Garrett Wilson", "Derrick Barnes", "Kene Nwangwu", "Patrick Jones II", "Riley Patterson", "Zach Davidson"]}, {"author": "DOESNT_OWN_AN_AUDI", "created_utc": 1628447995, "id": "p0k8n4", "score": 1, "selftext": "Timothy Tannehill finished last year with 40 total touchdowns with only 7 interceptions, while also throwing 3800 yards with a 1.5% INT percentage \n\nI think the major conclusion people draw here are Derrick Henry carried him to these stats, which I agree with to an extent", "subreddit": "nfl", "title": "Do you think Ryan Tannehill is a top 5 quarterback?", "created": 1628469595.0, "players": ["Ryan Tannehill", "Derrick Henry"]}, {"author": "BRotofantasy", "created_utc": 1628436693, "id": "p0gr57", "score": 1, "selftext": "We at BRoto have always been QB late drafters.

This was originally designed to be a ranking of the top 100  players in the league, regardless of position, for the upcoming season.  And while this has more and more become a comparison of resumes and  altered its criteria, in the spirit of what this was intended to be, I  listed what I thought were the very best players, in relation to how  good they are at their position coming into 2021. What I changed this  year was actually putting ratings on these players \u2013 sort of Madden  style \u2013 and one by one incorporating them into the list, while debating  back and forth when multiple guys shared the same number.\n\nThere are six names to start off with, who didn\u2019t qualify for my  list. I believe they all deserve to be on it, but I just didn\u2019t know  where to put them, because of how long it\u2019s been since we\u2019ve seen them  on the field, how often they\u2019ve gotten hurt recently or because we just  don\u2019t know if/when we will see them play again.\n\nI also added the 30 names that just missed the cut. So it\u2019s almost a  top 130, because I always have a tough time leaving those names off, but  I feel pretty good about the ultimate rankings that I put together  here.\n\nFor analysis, just click on the video, where I work my way from the bottom to the top!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbNE0KxkrwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbNE0KxkrwE)  \n\n\nThe official countdown premieres two days from now, but I\u2019m filming this here on August 4th  \u2013 just in case any players were to suffer an injury or some other news  coming out, that would change the availability of certain players. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n### Did not qualify:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijc078tlt4h71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c59e459a108cb587959379d6a88c53aa29ce94d6\n\n \n\nMichael Thomas \u2013 foot surgery in late July leads to uncertainty of when he\u2019ll be available\n\nDerwin James \u2013 only five total games over these last 2 years combined\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. \u2013 played in just 25 total games over these last four years\n\nDanielle Hunter \u2013 scary back surgery before last season even started, is something I want to see play out first\n\nMitchell Schwartz \u2013 currently still a free agent, who has hinted at possible retirement\n\nDeshaun Watson \u2013 for obvious reason, he\u2019s a top 15 player in the league otherwise\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# The list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezqd01ert4h71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=480f999d1fb85967293927e35f8ec71924b7c140\n\n \n\n1.

John Elway is the most important figure in Denver Broncos history. Without John, we don\u2019t have a single Lombardi. Without John, we\u2019d be without of one of the most impressive drives in NFL lore. Without John, I might be a *baseball* fan. Yuck. While the past five years have been\u2026what\u2019s a nice word for it\u2026unpalatable\u2026John Elway was an objectively great executive for this team. After a near-decade of purgatory (2005\u2019s mustachioed glory notwithstanding), Elway brought this franchise back into relevance. He secured one of the league\u2019s most historically pivotal free agents in Peyton Manning, he architected on of the league\u2019s most prolific offenses, he completely reinvented the defensive side of the roster after that prolific offense took a giant shit on itself in front of 111.5 million viewers, and he managed to do it all while [permanently blackout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqR8AEuTe4g). After years of trying and failing to find himself in a quarterback, John made the wise decision to promote himself\u2014now just the President of Football Operations\u2014and usher in a new era in Broncos Front Office personnel. Which brings us to\u2026\n\n**General Paton Takes Over**\n\nThe supposed most-coveted GM candidate in the NFL. A man who turned down prior interview requests several times, and an overall [*cool*](https://www.startribune.com/george-paton-vikings-broncos-general-manager/600010097/) guy\u2014George Paton. A 14-year Viking vet, George Paton is widely regarded as one of the smartest NFL execs around. He worked his way up to management from a lowly scouting position and prides himself on getting eyes on players as often as possible. During his time in Minnesota, he\u2019s credited with helping the team acquire 22 Pro Bowl players in total. Once Paton relieved John of his GMing duties, he immediately got to work digging into the team, its current roster, its needs, and its fans. I\u2019ll get into Paton\u2019s moves a bit more later in the post but, suffice to say\u2014we like George Paton so far. And you know what George Paton likes? DBs.\n\n**Kelly Kleine Makes History**\n\nIn a very cool early move, Paton brought with him one of the league\u2019s foremost female NFL executives, and promoted her to Executive Director of Football Operations. Having spent a decade with the Vikings, Kleine managed both collegiate and pro scouting, along with draft operations. This move marks the highest-ranking female scouting hire in NFL history. Go Kelly. Go George. Way cool.\n\n**Annnnnnnd\u2026the Ownership Situation**\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into it, but the team may be up for sale in the coming months/year. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t get sold to Bezos. I have no interest in that (literal) knob owning our team. RIP Pat. We miss you immensely.\n\n\\---\n\n# Coaching Room\n\n// NOTABLE DEPARTURES //\n\n**GREEK**\n\nGREEEEEEEEEEEK. After 45 years\u2014yes, you read that right\u2014with the Denver Broncos, Steve Antonopulous has officially retired. Greek\u2019s impact has been felt through eight Super Bowl appearances, ten General Managers, and three and a half team owners. As the team\u2019s Head Trainer and Get-Better Czar, Greek was beloved by *all* in Mile High and across Broncos Country. [This video](https://www.denverbroncos.com/video/salute-to-greek-colleagues-friends-and-broncos-players-congratulate-antonopulos-) sums up Greek, the man. No words can truly sum up Greek\u2019s impact on this team.\n\n// CURRENT STAFF //\n\n**Vic Fangio \u2014 HC**\n\nYou know, Vic\u2019s had a bit of a rough go at it in his head coaching tenure. He\u2019s got a 12-20 record. He\u2019s missed the playoffs each year. He\u2019s made some seriously questionable play clock decisions. His defenses haven\u2019t lived up to his time in Chicago. All that said, Vic\u2019s been dealt a bit of a shit hand. His quarterback play has been abysmal. Practically a third of his team was injured last year, including 11 on IR by October. I\u2019m not ready to throw in the towel on Vic just yet. This season will be pivotal\u2014does George Paton burn it all down after missing the playoffs for a third straight year, or does Vic hang his hat on (what should be) a historically great defense, despite spotty QB play? Yes, we\u2019re resigned to that. It\u2019s fine.\n\n**Pat Shurmur \u2014 OC**\n\nPat, on the other hand, I\u2019m totally cool with letting go. Did you know that Drew Lock has one of the league\u2019s highest completions rates when rolling out of the pocket in play action? And guess which team has one of the league\u2019s lowest play action passing percentages? Pat Shurmur is supposed to be a quarterback whisperer, but he was unable to un-lock consistency at the position last year. Here\u2019s to hoping that Drew\u2019s first-ever second-year system sticks. If not, I\u2019m all for burning it down.\n\n**Ed Donatell \u2014 DC**\n\nI have no idea how much of the Defense\u2019s marginal success is due to Ed\u2019s or Vic\u2019s brilliance, but we\u2019ve managed to not suck despite having one of the league\u2019s worst offenses two years running, and, even more impressively, we somehow held up the league\u2019s 13th-best defense (DVOA) despite fielding practice squad corners and matchsticks on the line. The players love Ed, so Ed\u2019s cool in my book.\n\n**Tom McMahon \u2014 ST**\n\nWe Broncos fans don\u2019t love Tom McMahon. To be honest, I don\u2019t know enough about Special Teams coaching to give a reasonable analysis as to why we don\u2019t like him. There was some stuff about asking punters to change the way they kick. That seems weird. We\u2019ve also had some [boneheaded mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mub1h-vpB5c). He\u2019s certainly not getting invited to dinner by Belichick anytime soon.\n\n**Remaining (Primary) Staff**\n\n|POS|COACH|\n|:-|:-|\n|**QB**|Mike Shula|\n|**RB**|Curtis Modkins|\n|**WR**|Zach Azzanni|\n|**TE**|Wade Harman|\n|**OL**|Mike Munchak|\n|**DL**|Bill Kollar|\n|**LB**|Reggie Herring|\n|**OLB**|John Pagano|\n|**DB**|Christian Parker|\n|**S&amp;C**|Loren Landow|\n\n\\---\n\n# Free Agency\n\n**Players Lost/Cut/Traded**\n\n|POS|PLAYER|NEW TEAM|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**QB**|Jeff Driskel|Houston Texans|\n|**RB**|Phillip Lindsay|Houston Texans|\n|**WR**|DaeSean Hamilton|Free Agent|\n|**TE**|Jake Butt|RETIRED|\n|**TE**|Nick Vannett|New Orleans Saints|\n|**RT**|Ju-Wuan James|Baltimore Ravens|\n|**OT**|Demar Dotson|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|\n|**OG**|Elijah Wilkinson|Chicago Bears|\n|**EDGE**|Jeremiah Attaochu|Chicago Bears|\n|**EDGE**|Anthony Chickillo|RETIRED|\n|**DE**|Jurrell Casey|Free Agent|\n|**DE**|DeMarcus Walker|Houston Texans|\n|**DE**|Joel Heath|Detroit Lions|\n|**DT**|Sylvester Williams|Free Agent|\n|**ILB**|Joseph Jones|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|\n|**CB**|A.J.

Phillip Linsday was the juice. A pure, unbridled electricity that kept this corpse of an offense animated long enough to save Broncos Country from fatal liver disease season-in and season-out. He has the mane of a lion and the heart of an even bigger lion. Sure, he wasn\u2019t too big himself, but boy did he play big. Kid could hit. Like, [seriously hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdXdMFWewF4). Despite his small frame, Lindsay never shied away from contact and always bounced right back up. He\u2019s a physical specimen who can break off a homerun on [any given play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvUfzQlgC1I). He\u2019s shifty. [He likes smelling salts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hxv5uvtgFU). He\u2019s everything you\u2019d want in a runner, except for, well, you know, the kind of body that would stay healthy for a full season. Broncos Country loved Phillip Lindsay and we\u2019re very sorry to see him go. Particularly to the Texans. God save him.\n\n**Ja\u2019Wuan James Packs His (Unreasonably Hefty) Bags**\n\nThis one\u2026doesn\u2019t make me sad. This was far and away John\u2019s worst Free Agent signing as the Broncos\u2019 GM. 63 snaps. This man made $17MM for just 63 snaps. I\u2019m not heartless\u2014I do feel for the guy, having torn his Achilles in May. I wish him a speedy recovery. But dear lord, if the Ravens expect to get anything near a full season out of him\u2026\\*wew\\* The James signing marked one of the worst periods of Right Tackle play in Broncos history, a position we\u2019ve still yet to find a solid solution for. Thank god Bolles figured out how to play Left Tackle, or we might have had utterly terrible QB play last season. Oh, wait.\n\n**No Room for BaeSean**\n\nThough there was initial trade interest in DaeSean Hamilton, the Broncos ultimately waived the fourth-year receiver after another below-starting season on the depth chart. With two promising rookie receivers drafted last year, along with the emergence of Tim Patrick as a viable WR2, there simply wasn\u2019t enough room for DaeSean on the roster anymore. To add injury to insult, Hamilton tore his ACL during an offseason workout, effectively squashing any hope of rostering this year.\n\n**2020 FA Woes**\n\nBouye, was 2020 a tough year for injuries (ba-dum tss). After a promising Free Agency period that saw splashy defensive additions like DE Jurrell Casey and CB A.J. Bouye, the Broncos struggled to keep their (well-paid) stars on the field. As we all know, the best ability is availability\u2014both Casey and Bouye became cap casualties at the head of the new league year.\n\n**Players Re-Signed/Tagged/Extended**\n\n|POS|PLAYER|CONTRACT|TOTAL|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**WR**|Tim Patrick|1 Year|$3.38MM|\n|**WR**|Diontae (God Peed) Spencer|2 Year|$1.52MM|\n|**OT**|Calvin Anderson|1 Year|$0.85MM|\n|**EDGE**|Von Miller|5th Year Option|$114.5MM|\n|**DT**|Shelby Harris|3 Year|$27MM|\n|**ILB**|Alexander Johnson|1 Year|$3.38MM|\n|**SS**|Kareem Jackson|1 Year|$5MM|\n|**FS**|Justin Simmons|4 Year|$61MM|\n|**FS**|Trey Marshall|1 Year|$0.66MM|\n\n// NOTABLE KEEPATURES //\n\n**Von Miller in Six**\n\nVon\u2019s back, baby. Hopefully forever? I\u2019d like to hear \u201cthis one\u2019s for Von\u201d amidst orange and blue confetti sometime in the next three years, thus completing the triumvirate of Denver Broncos legends I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be alive to witness make my father cry\u2014in action! In an immediate sign of good faith to me, specifically, George Paton and the Broncos exercised the sixth-year option on Von\u2019s $18MM salary, guaranteeing him at least $7MM this season. Should his health stay on the up-and-up, getting Von for just $18MM will look like a steal.\n\n**Boomerang Kareem**\n\nKareem Jackson has been one of the brightest spots on in an otherwise gloomy few seasons for the Broncos in recent years. Every good defense needs a hitter\u2014someone to [set the tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPd22C46wGo) for the rest of the team. In the No Fly Zone, that role was skillfully filled by both TJ Ward and Darian Stewart. In this iteration of the Broncos D, Kareem Jackson [wears that badge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oWaNnvoWfA) proudly. The Broncos declined the third-year option on his contract to kick off Free Agency, so Kareem decided to test the market. With nothing interesting (enough) biting, he returned on a team-friendly $5MM deal that keeps our hitter in Denver for one more year.\n\n**Locking Down Our Lock-Down**\n\nOnce again building some serious equity in my book, George Paton made the franchise-gratifying decision to offer Justin Simmons\u2014the league\u2019s near-best safety\u2014a four-year, $61MM contract, making him the league\u2019s highest-paid safety. While it initially looked as though Simmons would once again be forced to play on the Franchise Tag, Paton quickly inked a deal soon after the tag was agreed to. In five seasons, Simmons has totaled 369 (nice) tackles, 37 PBUs, 16 INTs, 2 sacks and a defensive touchdown. He\u2019s also one of the team\u2019s most active community members, an advocate for Black players in the league, and just an overall stand-up guy. We\u2019re lucky to have him.\n\n**Best Hands in the League**\n\nRounding out the excellent decision-making by this Front Office, enter: Shelby Harris. Though his teammates [don\u2019t think too highly of him as a man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbU2-xx1niY), they certainly think highly of him as a player. [As they should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsj2jI7VxTA). In 2019 alone, Harris notched *nine* pass breakups, along with 6 sacks, 49 tackles and a forced fumble. While 2020 was a bit wonky, stats-wise, Shelby has quickly become one of the predominate leaders on the team. The broncos inked him to a three-year, $27MM deal, anchoring one of the league\u2019s most effective interior lineman without handicapping the team. So long as the team can [put up with him](https://streamable.com/aszcy1), anyway.\n\n**Players Signed/Traded For**\n\n|POS|PLAYER|OLD TEAM|LENGTH|TOTAL|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**QB**|Teddy Bridgewater|Carolina Panthers|1 Year|$11.5MM|\n|**RB**|Mike Boone|Minnesota Vikings|2 Year|$3.85MM|\n|**WR**|Amara Darboh|N/A|1 Year|$0.85MM|\n|**WR**|De'Mornay Pierson-El|N/A|2 Year|$1.48MM|\n|**OT**|Bobby Massie|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$4MM|\n|**OT**|Cameron Fleming|New York Giants|1 Year|$1.67MM|\n|**OT**|Cody Conway|N/A|2 Year|$1.66MM|\n|**TE**|Eric Saubert|Jacksonville Jaguars|1 Year|$0.99MM|\n|**EDGE**|Pita Taumoepenu|Atlanta Falcons|1 Year|$0.85MM|\n|**DE**|Shamar Stephen|Minnesota Vikings|1 Year|$2MM|\n|**DT**|Isaiah Mack|Tennesse Titans|1 Year|$0.85MM|\n|**LB**|Peter Kalambayi|Houston Texans|1 Year|$0.92MM|\n|**CB**|Kyle Fuller|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$9.5MM|\n|**CB**|Ronald Darby|Washington Football Team|3 Year|$30MM|\n\n// NOTABLE NOT-SIGNINGS //\n\n**The QB Carousel Goes Round \u2018n Round**\n\nI really don\u2019t want to talk about this. If I have to watch even *one* more version of some junior ESPN animator\u2019s shitty rendition of a country fair ride featuring our failed quarterbacks, I swear to a-a-rod, I\u2019m switching to tennis. In half as many years, the Broncos have fielded 10 starting (or pseudo-starting) quarterbacks. 10. To salt the wound, we Broncos fans\u2014na\u00efve as we are\u2014thought we might come away with a shiny old Free Agent this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a Potential Sleeper Trade Partner for Matthew Stafford\u2026\u201d sure, Klis. \u201cDeshaun Watson wants to join Denver Broncos, ex-teammate says\u2026\u201d HA! \u201cAaron Rodgers to Denver\u2026as close to a done deal as it can be\u2026\u201d \\*sigh\\* somebody, please, just wake me up when we\u2019ve hit the Dalton line. The reality is, we\u2019ve got one more season of mediocrity at quarterback until boat rocking can commence. A new GM won\u2019t gamble away picks, players or surefire hall-of-fame cornerbacks (see: Draft Night writeup) in his first few months on the job. It\u2019s just not happening. And until it does, I\u2014for one\u2014plan on getting well acquainted with the floor.\n\n// NOTABLE SIGNINGS //\n\n**QB Teddy Bridgewater (2021 6th RD Pick &gt; Panthers // 1YR // $11.5MM // $10MMG)**\n\nWhelp, I\u2019m whelmed. The pre-draft trade rush for Teddy Bridgewater is at once a head-scratcher and a perfect fit for the post-Manning QB purgatory-era Broncos. For a daunting (sweet baby jeebus, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s only) backup quarterback\u2019s contract, the Broncos are on the hook for just up to $4.5MM this year. That\u2019s not terrible for 2020\u2019s 3rd-best completer of passes. Yes, Teddy threw 11 interceptions on the season (T-9th). And yes, he only threw for 15 touchdowns (24th). PFF isn\u2019t gospel\u2026but a 31st-overall ranked QB rating doesn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence after five consecutive losing seasons. Maybe Teddy can return to his former New Orlean glory. Maybe I\u2019ll finally work up the courage to ask Emma Watson out. Dreamers dream.\n\n**RB Mike Boone (2YR // $3.85MM // $2.6MMG)**\n\nI think Mike Boone will surprise more than a few people this year. A former UDFA, a Special Teams ace, and a decisive one-cut back, Boone has averaged 5.4 yards per carry across just 40 carries in his young career. He\u2019s also logged 523 Special Teams snaps and was well-regarded as one of the Vikings\u2019 most reliable four-phase ST players\u2014even earning an NFC Special Teams Player of the Week award. With high-level athleticism\u2014balance, speed, and burst\u2014and excellent vision, Mike Boone would have likely earned a spot as the Broncos\u2019 clear No.2 back. But, alas. He\u2019ll [certainly contribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOuSiiVsLiI) in some form.\n\n**OT Bobby Massie (1YR // $4MM // $1.575MMG)**\n\nGoing into his 10th year, Bobby Massie has been around the block. He even held Von to zero pressures against the Chicago Bears in 2019. At 6 feet and 325 pounds, Massie\u2019s size and athleticism have held up over the years. I\u2019m not going to pretend like I know enough to properly evaluate tackles, but I do know someone who does\u2014Mike Munchak, whose glowing review of Massie is enough for me. A wise man once said that the best ability is availability and, given the Broncos\u2019 recent woes at right tackle\u2026I\u2019m just glad we\u2019re no longer fielding traffic cones.\n\n**CB Kyle Fuller (1YR // $9.5MM // $9MMG)**\n\n\\[*Enter Full House Pun Here*\\]. Our CB room is overstuffed. And, sure, there probably won\u2019t be a year two of this relationship. But if you\u2019re going to burn a one-year rental on anyone, it might as well be an All-Pro CB who reached the height of his game under your current head coach. At the time of his signing, acquiring Kyle Fuller felt like (and arguable still is) a steal\u2014the Broncos suffered catastrophic losses to their CB room in 2020, resulting in a (don\u2019t you f\\*cking say it) carousel of 3rd-team and practice squad corners by December. Kyle Fuller is an *excellent* cornerback who is poised to lead the league in quarterback nightmares.\n\n**CB Ronald Darby (3YR // $30MM // $19.5MMG)**\n\nYou know, in the chaos of our run on cornerbacks this offseason, it feels like Ronald Darby got a little lost. Sure, he may have been made redundant by our first-round pick, but Darby was a [solid-to-great cornerback in Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIAhQsfL6E4), giving up just one touchdown and allowing only a 54.1 completion percentage last year. Admittedly, his contract isn\u2019t great. But with Kyler Fuller and Bryce Callahan likely to leave at the end of the season, Darby will likely play a lasting role in this secondary. Darby led the league in pass deflection is 2020 with 15. He won the CB2 job in Washington handily, despite coming in as a maybe-CB4 prospect. While he\u2019s struggled to stay on the field during his career, he\u2019s got a bright future in Denver under Vic and Ed.\n\n\\---\n\n# Draft\n\n|Pick|POS|PLAYER|SCHOOL|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1.09 (9)|**CB**|Patrick Surtain II|Alabama|\n|2.03 (35)|**RB**|Javonte Williams|North Carolina|\n|3.35 (98)|**C**|Quinn Meinerz|Wisconsin-Whitewater|\n|3.42 (107)|**LB**|Baron Browning|Ohio State|\n|5.08 (152)|**S**|Caden Sterns|Texas|\n|5.20 (164)|**S**|Jamar Johnson|Indiana|\n|6.35 (219)|**WR**|Seth Williams|Auburn|\n|7.09 (237)|**CB**|Kary Vincent Jr.|LSU|\n|7.11 (239)|**LB**|Jonathon Cooper|Ohio State|\n|7.26 (253)|**DE**|Marquiss Spencer|Mississippi State|\n\n**1.09 (9): CB Patrick Surtain II**\n\nIn the ninth pick of the 2021 NFL draft, the Denver Broncos select\u2026wait, what? I\u2019m sure that I speak for most Broncos fans when I say that, after Niners and Panthers passed on Justin Fields, I was salivating at the idea of drafting a potential top-3 prospect without giving up any picks or players. What fools we (hopefully) were. The Broncos elected to select the top player on their board, Patrick Surtain II\u2014a surefire Hall of Famer and literal Deion Sanders incarnate, who will go on to pick off Justin Fields at least once in 2022 before the Bears eventually trade him to the Dolphins for a 5th round pick and a bag of peanuts. Speaking of salty things, I\u2019m doing great, thanks. In truth, Surtain II was an excellent pick for us. Though we loaded up on high-performing corners in free agency, and drafted Iowa\u2019s Michael Ojemudia in the third last year, Surtain II\u2019s resume speaks for itself. His measurables? Off the charts. His football IQ? Honed since he was a wee lad. His accolades? Only getting started. The 2020 SEC Defensive Player of the Year has a bright future ahead of him, and the Denver Broncos are lucky to have him. Let\u2019s just hope we show him some love\u2014a half-decade of poor QB play does things to a fan\u2026\n\n***TRADE! Broncos give 2.08 (40), 4.09 (114), Falcons give 2.03 (35), 6.35 (219)***\n\n**2.03 (35): RB Javonte Williams**\n\nFor as confused as I was about our first-round pick, Javonte to Denver felt like destiny. I spent hours watching Javonte truck ACC defenders like a sentient bowling ball in the lead-up to the draft and mocked him us no less than eight times. In his 2020 season, and despite being part of a two-headed attack with Michael Carter, Javonte ran for over 1K yards and 19 touchdowns at 7.4 yards per carry. The kicker? 75\u2014yes, 75\u2014broken tackles, a rate of nearly half a broken tackle PER RUSH. That\u2019s a PFF record, by the by. But don\u2019t just take it from me\u2014here\u2019s what Javonte has to say about his running style: \u201cIf I see someone in front of me, I want to go through them\u2026\u201d [Remind you of anyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1XKjzq1_aM)? Javonte\u2019s linebacker upbringing is a sure contributor to his utter dad-dicking on the field, and I, for one, can't wait for this man to put the team on his back, doe. \n\n***TRADE! Broncos give 3.07 (71), Giants give 3.12 (76), 5.20 (164)***\n\n***TRADE! Broncos give 3.12 (76), Saints give 3.35 (98), 3.42 (105)***\n\n**3.35 (98): C Quinn Meinerz**\n\nIs there anything more loveable in this world than a delightfully large man-child who\u2019s unabashedly proud of his delightful largeness? Nicknamed \u201cthe belly,\u201d Meinerz is infamous for letting his pooch hang low\u2014though nowhere near the flo\u2014and his shirt sinch high. \u201cLet the belly breathe\u201d is the rallying cry/convenient excuse I can only assume I will use consistently throughout my future Dad years. Before the draft, George Paton hadn\u2019t even seen the [tree tackling video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV1OPvGanGQ)\u2014he and the staff got a kick out of it on the big screen just before they made the call. But enough about that. Meinerz is a highly athletic small school blocker who took the Senior Bowl by storm earlier this year. With any luck, he\u2019ll push a struggling Lloyd Cushenberry III and elevate our Center position to its former glory. We do have Munch, after all.\n\n**3.42 (105): LB Baron Browning**\n\nAnother player I mocked to the Broncos several times\u2014I was pleased to see that we haven\u2019t given up on the linebacker position entirely\u2026particularly with rumors of trading down in the first for JOK and Kollmann\u2019s whiskey-swilling baritone lulling me into a false sense of anticipation all offseason. Baron Browning is an exciting prospect for us\u2014he can play outside or inside, he\u2019s a hard-nosed tackler, and he has a clear Predator vision for the football. Unfortunately, Browning caught the injury bug early in OTAs, and will be off to a slow start with the team. Hopefully he\u2019ll fit right in when he returns, despite the lack of early reps.\n\n**5.08 (152): S Caden Sterns**\n\nI was a bit surprised to see that we drafted a safety here, though Caden Sterns is great coverage Safety prospect that should play a significant role in the Broncos\u2019 defense in the years to come. He plays with great control, vision and athleticism, but, at the same time, struggles against the run. For a guy that\u2019s built like a downhill safety, he\u2019ll need to clean up his tackling and first-jump instincts to be able to eventually take over as a starter on this defense. Learning from the likes of Justin Simmons and Kareem Jackson won\u2019t hurt.\n\n**5.20 (164): S Jamar Johnson**\n\nI was even more surprised to see us double dip at safety in the fifth round. Who needs an interior line when the Quarterback has literally no one to pass to, am I right? Guys? In any case, Jonson is another great prospect that has potential to turn starter in the coming years (they all do, don\u2019t they? The sunnies sure are rosy this time of year\u2026). Johnson also did secure Teddy Bridgewater\u2019s only interception of minicamp, so that\u2019s something. Johnson will likely see early playing time on Special Teams. Although, in the time that\u2019s passed since I initially wrote this, Jamar was put on the COVID exemption list. Not a good look, Jamar.\n\n**6.35 (219): WR Seth Williams**\n\nOur WR room is stacked at the moment, but another big body can\u2019t hurt. Seth Williams is 6\u20192 and 211lbs of pure Red Zone intrigue, racking up Auburn\u2019s fourth-most career receiving yards (2,124) in just three years. He\u2019s apparently intrigued at camp and could be an excellent stand-in for our other big-bodied receivers, should we need it. I like Seth Williams. Check out [this nasty little number](https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/n2twt3/pff_broncos_6thround_pick_seth_williams_auburn/). I initially had him pegged for a roster spot, but he\u2019s had a pretty quiet camp so far.\n\n**7.09 (237): CB Kary Vincent Jr.**\n\nAgain with the Secondary, seriously? What is up with this offseason? Last year must\u2019ve been seriously scarring to Vic\u2019s defensive sensibilities. Kary Vincent Jr. is a slot corner out of LSU who was initially graded as a fourth-round prospect. He\u2019s been praised for his instinct, work ethic and football IQ, but time will tell as to whether that\u2019s enough to bump one of the Broncos\u2019 48 corners off of the roster. That said, if last year taught us anything, a strong bench of practice squad players is absolutely necessary.\n\n**7.11 (239): OLB Jonathon Cooper**\n\nHow can you not love a guy whose [neighborhood loves him](https://twitter.com/OhioStateFB/status/1389002304263753730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1389002304263753730%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.milehighreport.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22451348%2Fbroncos-roster-review-jonathon-cooper)? The Broncos made it clear that they prioritized high-character guys this draft, and Jonathon Cooper is the perfect example. Here\u2019s what George Paton had to say; \u201cI went to the Ohio State pro day. Watched the way he competed and the way he went about his workout and took it serious. How he worked out and the type of shape he was in. Then you speak with the kid. He\u2019s everything you want in a teammate and a player representing the organization.\u201d We\u2019ve seen a few [flashes](https://twitter.com/MaseDenver/status/1422613449775980550?s=20) from Cooper in camp, particularly during the first padded practice. He\u2019s also got a [big heart](https://twitter.com/TroyRenck/status/1422622731875627011). What\u2019s not to love?\n\n**7.26 (253): DE Marquiss Spencer**\n\nAt nearly 300 pounds, Marquiss Spencer could be a dominating force on the line. This behemoth of a human being recorded five sacks and 14.5 TFL in just 22 starts and has experience both as a 3-technique and 4-technique backer. Assuming he doesn\u2019t eat one of his coaches, I don\u2019t see why\u2014given our line depth\u2014Spencer wouldn\u2019t make the practice squad.\n\n**Notable UDFA: EDGE Andre Mintze**\n\nA two-time team captain and four-year speed rusher out of Vanderbilt, Mintze clocked one of the fastest 40-yd dash times at 4.59. The Broncos are known for shining up gemstones out of their UDFA recruits, and Dre Mintze might well be the next in line. Mintze has the smarts and the work ethic (a well-decorated master\u2019s earner), and while he does struggle against the run, his ceiling has yet to be uncovered. The Broncos gave him a sizable UDFA contract ($85,000 gtd)\u2014Mintze may make an immediate impact on special teams.\n\n\\---\n\n# Projected 53-Man Roster\n\n|POS|1|2|3|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**OFFENSE**||||\n|QB|Drew Lock|Teddy Bridgewater||\n|RB|Melvin Gordon|Javonte Williams|Mike Boone|\n|WR|Cortland Sutton|Tim Patrick|Trinity Benson|\n|LT|Garett Bolles|||\n|LG|Dalton Risner|Austin Schlottmann||\n|C|Lloyd Cushenberry III|Quinn Meinerz||\n|RG|Graham Glasgow|Netane Muti||\n|RT|Bobby Massie|Calvin Anderson||\n|TE|Noah Fant|Albert Ogkuebunam|Andrew Beck|\n|WR|Jerry Jeudy|KJ Hamler|Diontae Spencer|\n|||||\n|**DEFENSE**||||\n|EDGE|Von Miller|Malik Reed|Jonathon Cooper|\n|DE|Shelby Harris|Dre'Mont Jones|DeShawn Williams|\n|DT|Mike Purcell|McTelvin Agim|Shamar Stephen|\n|EDGE|Bradley Chubb|Derek Tuszka||\n|LB|Alexander Johnson|Justin Strnad||\n|LB|Josey Jewell|Baron Browning||\n|CB|Kyle Fuller|Ronald Darby||\n|SS|Kareem Jackson|Caden Sterns|Jamar Johnson|\n|FS|Justin Simmons|P.J.

Most members of the Broncos sub are tired of supercharged negative emotions driving the conversation about our most problematic room, so let\u2019s just look at the cold, dead facts. No Broncos quarterback has reached top-20 in the league since Peyton limped off into the sunset. Trevor Siemian\u2014the current 4th-man up in New Orleans\u2014boasts the strongest record and best rating among this group. At least we\u2019ve got no shortage of options\u2014like calling up our DB-WR PS convert (read: HERO) to the helm with less than 24 hours to prepare. Since you\u2019re all waiting for it, let\u2019s get this death march over with. Trevor Siemian. Brock Osweiler. Paxton Lynch. Mark Sanchez. Chad Kelly. Case Keenum. Kevin Hogan. Joe Flacco. Brandon Allen. Brett Rypien. Jeff Driskel. Drew Lock. And now, Teddy Bridgewater. By all accounts, Drew and Teddy are all tied up in this year\u2019s competition. There have been flashes. The offense looks leagues better than prior years. And yet, quarterbacks finished their latest practice with a pair of Red Zone picks after promising, full-field drives. It\u2019s poetic, really. Even without John, we Broncos fans are doomed to relive every \u2018promising offseason with flashes of brilliance\u2019 only to once again have our nuts kicked in by shitty Quarterback play. Is this what we *actually* gave up for Peyton? Is duck-slinging mediocrity meets picks-akimbo really our destiny? \\*sigh\\* If being a lifelong Broncos fan has taught me anything, it\u2019s this\u2014enjoy the good times while they\u2019re rolling. The road between is dark and full of terrors.\n\n**Backfield\u2014Strength**\n\nOkay, enough of the doom and gloom. There\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to be a rumblin\u2019, bumblin\u2019, shit-in-your-mouth-then-spit-in-your-eye football team this year, thanks, in large part, to our tailbacks. I\u2019ve already waxed poetic about Javonte\u2014who, by the way, looked like the dynamic Tonka truck we know him to be during his first padded practice\u2014but Melvin Gordon certainly deserves some praise. Early camp reports note [how much faster](https://twitter.com/CameronParkerPO/status/1422607026795040770) Melvin has looked this offseason, breaking off several impressive runs during the team\u2019s first padded practice. Melvin was far and away our strongest runner last year, finishing with nearly 1K rushing yards and 10 all-purpose touchdowns. This is shaping up to be an excellent one-two punch that I\u2019m very excited to see. Oh, and don\u2019t sleep on Mike Boone. As coach Fangio stated a few days ago\u2014he\u2019s [got the juice](https://gazette.com/sports/broncos-training-camp-observations-rookie-olb-jonathon-cooper-standing-out-on-and-off-the-field/article_9a839736-f487-11eb-967e-6f6005bee917.html) (too\u2026miss u phil.)\n\n**Pass Catchers\u2014Strength**\n\nWew lawdy, look out league. If we can somehow wrangle up a halfway-decent passing game, this receiving room is going to the moon. Jerry Jeudy is [consistently](https://twitter.com/DP_NFL/status/1422276748566278146) getting [RIDICULOUS](https://twitter.com/PFN365/status/1422645700588933121) separation at camp and may soon surpass Courtland Sutton for WR1 already. Court looks great in his recovery, pulling in balls like [THIS](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/1423004851395600390) while still not at 100% (by the way, yes, I know\u2026this QB situation is sus). Tim Patrick was a breakout star last year. KJ Hamler has the kind of speed roadrunners dream of. Even guys like Trinity Benson seem to finding the endzone in consistent fashion. We\u2019ve got arguably the most talented room of pass catchers we\u2019ve had since 2013/2014\u2014if not more talented. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned Noah Fant\u2014who looks massive and spent time with the league\u2019s great TE\u2019s at Camp Kittle\u2014and Albert O who flashed last year. [We\u2019ve got weapons](https://twitter.com/Broncos/status/1421222066099945474) for days, if we can, you know, pass the damn ball to them.\n\n**Offensive Line\u2014Neutral**\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how this year\u2019s offensive line will shape up. On one hand, we\u2019ve got one of the league\u2019s most impressive Left Tackles in All Pro Garett Bolles. Sloth allowed just half a sack in 2020, along with just 13 pressures. He was a rockstar. He\u2019s also a great dad. We love our big ugly (even those of us who were *very* ugly to him in his first few years). On the other hand, rookie Lloyd Cushenberry III had a\u2026tough year. His play even regressed once-standout LG Dalton Risner last year. And don\u2019t even get me started on the things we\u2019ve allowed at Right Tackle. It just makes me sad. This is an up-and-down unit with a ton of promise (see\u2014Lloyd Cushenberry III bulking up, playing well and handily sweeping the \u201ccompetition\u201d at C so far, along with Netane Muti biting at Graham Glasgow\u2019s heels for a chance to eat a man live, on-air), but not a lot to show for itself. Yet. With Mike Munchack at the helm, only time will tell.\n\n**Defensive Line\u2014Neutral/Strength**\n\nOn the other side of the trenches, we\u2019ve got a nice mixture of young and old. Shelby Harris and Mc\u2019Telvin Agim have had a great camp so far\u2014the former disrupting with at the LOS with those big paws of his, the latter doing the same (and even hauling one in for a pick-six). Dre\u2019Mont Jones is [expected](https://twitter.com/ZacStevensDNVR/status/1422341441926443010) to take a significant leap this year. Mike Purcell (though nipped by the injury bug early in camp) is one of our premiere run-stoppers. If we can stay healthy, this is a [strong defensive line](https://twitter.com/ZacStevensDNVR/status/1422978757812424717) that can cause chaos for Quarterbacks.\n\n**Linebackers\u2014Neutral/Strength**\n\nBit of a tale of two houses in our linebacker group. On the outside, we\u2019ve got a surefire Hall of Famer and his two young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. While Von and Bradley Chubb have only been on the field together for one full season, that season was like magic (to the tune of 26.5 sacks.) Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 #2 Malik Reed had a phenomenal 2020 season for an otherwise unknown entity, recording 8 sacks ad 52 tackles. Von speaks very highly of Malik, who may just be another Shaq Barrett-like star [in the making](https://twitter.com/ZacStevensDNVR/status/1422967331202895873). Von also [cheats when he fishes with Malik](https://twitter.com/georgestoia/status/1400504290515460096?s=21), which\u2014to be taught by a future Hall of Famer\u2014seems like an ok trade to me. On the inside, however, we\u2019ve historically struggled to maintain balance. While our ILB core of Alexander Johnson and Josey Jewell post great run-stopping grades, they\u2019re notoriously bad at coverage, particularly against big, strong, fast tight ends. Justin Strnad is supposedly getting beat in practice, and we\u2019ve yet to see any action from Baron Browning due to injury. So, for now, I\u2019m cautiously pessimistic.\n\n**Secondary\u2014Strength**\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing this team is lacking, defensive backs in not it. Last year\u2019s unit, comprised of whacky inflatable used car promotional men and the other guys Mark Wahlberg tried out next to during that movie that one time, somehow managed to keep it together\u2026ish. But you bet your sweet ass October through December 2020 haunt Vic Fangio\u2019s indigestion nightmares. Despite already having one of the league\u2019s top Slot Corners in Bryce Callahan, two of the league\u2019s top Safeties in Kareem Jackson and Justin Simmons and having drafted Michael Ojemudia in the 3rd not one year ago, we\u2019ve managed to add ELEVEN defensive backs in just a few short months. Now, I\u2019m not complaining\u2014the prospect of No Fly Zone 2.0 makes me feel all tingly in my special place\u2014but I think Vic and Paton might have a problem. In any case, and by all account, this secondary is going to be MEAN. I mean, just look at them. They\u2019re picking off balls [left and right](https://twitter.com/Jeff_Legwold/status/1422994766157991938). They\u2019re [undercutting routes](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/1422274762823376897). They\u2019ve got a guy named [Rojesterman](https://twitter.com/ZacStevensDNVR/status/1422974550501859334). What more can a fan want?\n\n**Special Teams\u2014Neutral/Weakness**\n\nThis unit is a bit of an enigma. Brandon \u201cThe Godfather\u201d McManus is an excellent kicker that we\u2019re lucky to have. Though I do love me some [God Peed](https://twitter.com/DSpencer4_/status/1338284290379980800), we haven\u2019t exactly figured out the return man situation. Reports from camp indicate that we may throw KJ Hamler a few\u2026but forgive me if getting our promising new receiver clobbered doesn\u2019t excite me. We signed an Australian punter and then cut him in favor of Sam Martin. That\u2019s cool, I guess. Overall, I don\u2019t know much about Special Teams, but I do know that the unit hasn\u2019t over-performed in years. Maybe this year that\u2019ll change!\n\n\\---\n\n# Unreasonably Optimistic Schedule Predictions in the Comments Below\n\nShoutout u/PlatypusofDeath for putting up with my hectic work schedule and making this happen each year.

Throughout the season I write a weekly post reviewing the best unowned players that week. This has put the spotlight on a few players that we may otherwise miss. However, Fantasy Football is easy when you already know the scores. The real game of fantasy football is guessing the future. With that said I wanted to try out this introductory post so we can collectively look ahead to the Best Unowned Team for 2021. \n\nAs always, for the purposes of this post I will use %Owned from Yahoo and we will use 0.5 PPR scoring. The roster format is QB, RB1, RB2, WR1, WR2, TE, Flex, D/ST, K. The unowned team consists of players owned 5% of leagues or less.\n\n# Looking Back\n\nWhat better way to look ahead, than to start by looking back? I took over this post in 2018 and after 3 seasons I have noticed a few themes that show up on this team. \n\n## Here are the players that have been on the best unowned them the at least 3 times over the last three years:\n\n  |\\*\\*Rank\\*\\*|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|1|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|6|75|D/ST|\n\n|2|Jason Sanders - MIA|5|81|K|\n\n|3|David Moore - SEA|5|80.6|WR|\n\n|4|Atlanta Falcons|5|75|D/ST|\n\n|5|Dustin Hopkins - WAS|5|58|K|\n\n|6|New York Giants|5|58|D/ST|\n\n|7|Miami Dolphins|5|51|D/ST|\n\n|8|Buffalo Bills|5|48|D/ST|\n\n|9|Oakland Raiders|5|46|D/ST|\n\n|10|Josh Allen, BUF|4|99.78|QB|\n\n|11|Ryan Fitzpatrick - VAR|4|97.96|QB|\n\n|12|Zach Pascal - IND|4|77.2|WR|\n\n|13|Jeff Wilson Jr. - SF|4|75.6|RB|\n\n|14|Steven Sims Jr. - WAS|4|64.9|WR|\n\n|15|Willie Snead IV - BAL|4|62.8|WR|\n\n|16|Cairo Santos - VAR|4|55|K|\n\n|17|Devontae Booker - VAR|4|52.9|RB|\n\n|18|Jordan Wilkins - IND|4|52.3|RB|\n\n|19|Daniel Carlson - LV|4|49|K|\n\n|20|Kyle Juszczyk - SF|4|45.6|RB|\n\n|21|New York Jets|4|45|D/ST|\n\n|22|Gus Edwards- BAL|4|44.6|RB|\n\n|23|Kyle Allen - VAR|3|58.2|QB|\n\n|24|Dante Pettis, SF|3|56|WR|\n\n|25|Brandon Allen - VAR|3|54.04|QB|\n\n|26|Isaiah McKenzie - BUF|3|53.8|WR|\n\n|27|Hunter Renfrow - OAK|3|51.4|WR|\n\n|28|Tajae Sharpe - TEN|3|47.2|WR|\n\n|29|Anthony Firkser - TEN|3|44.1|TE|\n\n|30|Sam Ficken - NYJ|3|44|K|\n\n|31|Marcus Johnson - IND|3|43.1|WR|\n\n|32|Andy Isabella - ARI|3|42.7|WR|\n\n|33|Ricky Seals-Jones - CLE|3|42.3|TE|\n\n|34|Robert Foster,BUF|3|42.3|WR|\n\n|35|Brandon McManus - DEN|3|42|K|\n\n|36|Kalen Ballage - VAR|3|41.7|RB|\n\n|37|Dallas Goedert, PHI|3|41.5|TE|\n\n|38|Marvin Hall - WR - VAR|3|40.2|FLEX|\n\n|39|Darren Fells - VAR|3|39.1|TE|\n\n|40|Stephen Hauschka - BUF|3|39|K|\n\n|41|Ryquell Armstead - JAX|3|37.4|RB|\n\n|42|Brian Hill - ATL|3|37|RB|\n\n|43|Kapri Bibbs, WAS|3|34.7|RB|\n\n|44|Cameron Brate - TB|3|34.6|TE|\n\n|45|Wayne Gallman Jr. - NYG|3|30.7|RB|\n\n|46|Jacksonville Jaguars|3|30|D/ST|\n\n|47|Josh Adams - NYJ|3|29.3|RB|\n\nThe first thing that stands out to me are there are a lot of defenses at the top. This speaks to the difficulty in predicting that position. 4 of Tampa Bay\u2019s 6 appearances occurred in 2018. All 5 of Buffalo\u2019s appearances occurred in 2018. This year, both of them are being drafted in most leagues. Then you see Atlanta, Miami, NYG, and Oakland up high on the list and no one is rushing out to get them. The Dolphins have been underrated as a defense though, they were the 4th ranked fantasy defense last year. Perhaps they will join the ranks of drafted Defenses like TB and BUF.\n\n## Here\u2019s a list of everyone who has made the list each of the last three years:\n\n|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|Jason Sanders - MIA|5|81|K|\n\n|David Moore - SEA|5|80.6|WR|\n\n|Dustin Hopkins - WAS|5|58|K|\n\n|Miami Dolphins|5|51|D/ST|\n\n|Ryan Fitzpatrick - VAR|4|97.96|QB|\n\n|Zach Pascal - IND|4|77.2|WR|\n\n|Jeff Wilson Jr. - SF|4|75.6|RB|\n\n|Jordan Wilkins - IND|4|52.3|RB|\n\n|Gus Edwards- BAL|4|44.6|RB|\n\n|Isaiah McKenzie - BUF|3|53.8|WR|\n\n|Anthony Firkser - TEN|3|44.1|TE|\n\n|Kalen Ballage - VAR|3|41.7|RB|\n\n|Darren Fells - VAR|3|39.1|TE|\n\n|Wayne Gallman Jr. - NYG|3|30.7|RB|\n\nJason Sanders, David Moore and Dustin Hopkins are the only individual players (i.e. not D/ST) with 5 appearances on the best unowned team. \n\nDavid Moore seems to be a capable WR but has been stuck behind some combination of Doug Baldwin, Tyler Lockett, and D.K. Metcalf. Now that he is in Carolina, he is behind D.J. Moore and Robby Anderson, as well as camp reports saying rookie Terrace Marshall is outplaying him. My guess is more of the same, he\u2019ll pop onto the team once or twice this year.\n\nIf you use Kickers, I want to talk about Dustin Hopkins. We all have high hopes for McLaurin and Gibson. Logan Thomas and Curtis Samuel should be good too. All of this is elevated by the addition of Fitzpatrick. Hopkins could actually be a top 10 kicker this year if that offense takes a step forward like it should. Dustin Hopkins has been consistent enough to make this team each of the last three years and has been a top 10 kicker in the past. \n\nThere are 2 players here I don\u2019t want to see on the list this year. Let\u2019s do what we can to make sure that Ryan Fitzpatrick and Anthony Firkser are over 5% owned all year this year. With that said let me make a prediction: Fitzpatrick starts weeks 1-4. He plays poorly and Heinecke takes over. Fitzpatrick\u2019s ownership plummets. Heinecke starts for 4 weeks and then plays poorly week 7 and 8. Fitzpatrick comes out and lights it up after their bye in week 10 when his ownership is 2%. \n\nI also want to highlight Isaiah McKenzie. With John Brown\u2019s departure Gabe Davis and Cole Beasley are getting all the attention. You could do worse than throwing McKenzie into your flex, as he should benefit from those vacated targets as well. The presence of Robert Foster in 2018 also leads to the fact that this offense can support several WRs, especially as long as the run game is an afterthought in Buffalo.\n\nThe presence of Jeff Wilson on this list is not a reminder to take him in any drafts, it is a reminder that SF RBs do not stay healthy, and whichever are the top two any given week should return value. We also never know when one of the top two SF RBs is going to be Kyle Jusczyk. I am curious if Saleh and Mike LaFleur can replicate that RB Value with the Jets backfield. The RB rooms are even similarly built, veteran starter (Coleman/Mostert), Rookie draft pick (Carter/Sermon), performs well with opportunity (Josh Adams/Jeff Wilson) and others who can flash (Ty Johnson and La\u2019Mical Perine/Elijah Mitchell).\n\nKalen Ballage, how do you keep doing this? Every year you manage to make the team. He\u2019ll probably manage to do it again this year. Right now, it seems unlikely behind Najee, Snell and McFarland, but perhaps I should stop betting against Ballage.\n\n## Here\u2019s a list of 2019 rookies who made the list each of their first two years in the league:\n\nPerhaps more accurately, they made the list the first two years they recorded any stats, starting in 2019. \n\n|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|Andy Isabella - ARI|3|42.7|WR|\n\n|Dwayne Haskins Jr. - WAS|2|37.9|QB|\n\n|Darwin Thompson - KC|2|36.9|RB|\n\n|Olamide Zaccheaus - ATL|2|34.1|WR|\n\n|Byron Pringle - KC|2|32.5|WR|\n\n|Greg Ward - PHI|2|31.1|WR|\n\n|Reggie Bonnafon - CAR|2|28.1|RB|\n\n|Ty Johnson - VAR|2|26.4|RB|\n\n|Benny Snell Jr. - PIT|2|18.3|RB|\n\nThe name I want to talk about here is Byron Pringle. Mecole Hardman has not made this team once, likely because his ownership was always above 5%. Pringle however has been getting some camp hype and is surpassing Demarcus Robinson for WR3 in the high-powered KC offense. Pringle could be valuable if Hill or Hardman miss any time, and those speedsters tend to come up with hamstring issues at least once a year.\n\nOlamide Zaccheaus is another interesting name. Julio Jones is out and that leaves plenty of targets to spread. Ridley is assuredly elite this year, Gage should be solid as well but Zaccheaus has already shown flashes with Julio there and could be a bit more consistent even with the addition of Pitts.\n\n# Here are the top ten in total points for each of the last three years\n\n||\\*\\*2018 Team Member\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*Pos\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|1|Josh Allen, BUF|4|99.78|QB|\n\n|2|Dante Pettis, SF|3|56|WR|\n\n|3|Buffalo Bills|5|48|D/ST|\n\n|4|Brock Osweiler, MIA|2|45.76|QB|\n\n|5|C.J.

He was still being doubted going into the 2019 and even some into 2020, now he is a top QB in the league and getting paid to boot. He led Buffalo to have 4 players in the top 10 by score on this team (if you count the defense).\n\nI never understood the hype on Pettis, but now I see he actually produced some in 2018, his rookie year. I had forgotten all about that. I doubt he flourishes with the Giants, but I wouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised to see him pop up again on this list.\n\n||\\*\\*2019 Team Member\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*Pos\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|--:|--:|:--|\n\n|1|Steven Sims Jr. - WAS|4|64.9|WR|\n\n|2|Hunter Renfrow - OAK|3|51.4|WR|\n\n|3|Jeff Driskel - DET|2|46.02|QB|\n\n|4|New York Giants|3|44|D/ST|\n\n|5|Case Keenum - WAS|2|43.62|QB|\n\n|6|Ricky Seals-Jones - CLE|3|42.3|TE|\n\n|7|Brandon McManus - DEN|3|42|K|\n\n|8|Ryan Griffin - NYJ|2|42|TE|\n\n|9|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|2|39|D/ST|\n\n|10|Ryquell Armstead - JAX|3|37.4|RB|\n\nNo one here really jumps out to me. Sims is in a crowded room and changed coaches since 2019. Renfrow may be the most interesting. He may have as much chance as Edwards or Ruggs to emerge as the top WR option in LV. Any of them will be second fiddle to Waller though. \n\n||\\*\\*2020 Team Member\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*Pos\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|--:|--:|:--|\n\n|1|Mitchell Trubisky - CHI|2|45.06|QB|\n\n|2|Cairo Santos - CHI|3|45|K|\n\n|3|Devontae Booker - LV|3|40.8|RB|\n\n|4|Atlanta Falcons|3|39|D/ST|\n\n|5|Brandon Allen - CIN|2|37.02|QB|\n\n|6|Zach Pascal - IND|2|36.3|WR|\n\n|7|Willie Snead IV - BAL|2|35.3|WR|\n\n|8|Kyle Allen - WAS|2|33.86|QB|\n\n|9|Nelson Agholor - LV|2|32.9|WR|\n\n|10|David Moore - SEA|2|32.1|WR|\n\nBooker has been considered a decent handcuff option. His inclusion on this team each of the last 3 years speaks to that being true. However, camp reports suggest Corey Clement has been outperforming Booker in camp behind the injured Saquon. Either one could play early in the season and be valuable until Saquon returns.\n\n# So what do we learn from all this?\n\n1. Defenses and kickers are hard to predict, but there will always be good options to stream. \n2. Although the passing volume is low in Baltimore, Willie Snead carved out some decent games. I believe Hollywood, Watkins and Bateman are all more talented than Snead. Eventually one will emerge, and I think they will find some consistency this year at the WR position.\n3. Nelson Agholor could actually have a decent year. I suspect him to operate as the Patriots\u2019 WR1. He\u2019s been a fantasy WR2 a couple of times, and I tend to think that is his floor this year. The Patriots dealt with more opt outs than any other team last year. I suspect last year was an outlier for them, and they will return to being a good team. If Cam struggles again, the rookie Mac Jones has been promising in camp. Whoever emerges in NE should return value, I am guessing Agholor, Jonnu Smith, and Damien Harris will all be relevant this year, James White may return to PPR form as well.\n4. Muddled situations produce fantasy opportunity\u2026 If you guess right. See Jeff Wilson, Willie Snead, Darren Fells, Greg Ward. All of them had crowded position groups from the start, or an injury to a starter led to a committee. Consistency isn\u2019t there, but the opportunity to hit big for one week exists in these situations. If you are in a deep league and need a bye week fill in, these may be places to look.\n5. There are no bad players in the NFL, all of them are talented. If given the opportunity any of them can produce any given week. One broken play can lead to a long TD to Zay Jones. Ryquell Armstead could score a TD if given the ball on the 1 yd line for one play. In fantasy football it is consistency that increases ownership. The biggest predictor of consistency is number of touches. Included in this idea is backup QBs can still produce decent weeks.\n6. Lastly, a more meta deduction. The best unowned team is a far more valuable post in weeks 1 through 3 than later in the year. Those first few weeks can highlight players that will be featured in their offenses. By weeks 3 or 4, those players will be owned. Look for the players that could produce consistently. The ones with a path to consistent touches and the talent to capitalize. Later on in the year, be careful not to get sucked in by the one hit wonders. Injuries can propel backups to new opportunities but other than that, consistent players don\u2019t often emerge in the latter half of the season. \n\n# Who is making the team this year?\n\nI will start with the caveat that it seems %Owned isn\u2019t updated on Yahoo since the end of last season so I am also looking at Sleeper for %Rostered. It\u2019s hard to guess what the ownership will be during week 1. Bold players are possible inclusions on this team based on current ownership and potential points.\n\n* **QB**\n   * As I mentioned earlier, I would guess at least one of **Ryan Fitzpatrick** and **Taylor Heinecke** will make the team.\n   * **Dwayne Haskins** has found a way to make the team each year he\u2019s been in the league, and he is now behind an aging Big Ben. As an Oklahoma State alum, it pains me to say it, but the Rudolph experiment should probably be over.\n   * I bet **Davis Mills** gets a start for Houston this year, any starter that is less than 5% owned makes this team almost by default. Houston will be bad and a lot of people will leave him unowned, see Flacco last year with the Jets.\n   * Speaking of starters less than 5% owned, **Andy Dalton** will be the week 1 best unowned QB if his ownership remains this low.\n* **RB**\n   * **Salvon Ahmed** checks off a few boxes. Muddled situation, injury prone committee members, and has made the team before. \n   * Any SF RB with under 5% owned, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see **Elijah Mitchell** and **Kyle Jusczyk** on the team at least once this year. **Jeff Wilson\u2019s** ownership will probably dip below 5% just in time for him to fall into a 2 TD week as well.\n   * I mentioned him earlier, but I like **Corey Clement** to be the backup to Barkley and Gallman made this team in that role the last 3 years.\n   * **Kalen Ballage** is eternal. He will find a way to climb the depth chart for one game and then fade again into the ether. In case you have lost track, he is a Steeler now.\n* **WR**\n   * **Byron Pringle** will make this team more than once this year. KC offense has more meat on the bone than Kelce, Hill, and CEH can eat all by themselves. Hardman will be a benefactor, but I suspect Pringle to figure into the mix this year as well.\n   * Buffalo has consistently produced WRs on this team, this year I suspect that to be **Isaiah McKenzie**. Diggs, Gabe Davis and Cole Beasley should remain above 5% owned throughout the year, though Davis or Beasley could dip.\n   * With Julio moving north to Tennessee there are vacated targets aplenty in Atlanta. Ridley, Gage and Pitts will eat a lot of them, but **Olamide Zaccheaus** has been here before and is still unowned. I suspect Atlanta to not be great, so passing volume should be high. \n   * David Moore made the team a lot as a Seahawk and the Seattle passing volume is poised to increase with a new offensive coordinator in town. Metcalf and Lockett are rightly being drafted everywhere, but there is opportunity behind them. Look for **Freddie Swain** or rookie **D'Wayne Eskridge** to find themselves on this list at least once this year. Eskridge is currently on PUP so I\u2019d guess Swain.\n   * Oakland has also produced players for this list, and I\u2019d like to highlight **Hunter Renfrow** once more. The Oaklands WRs are young, and none have fully emerged. Ruggs and Edwards are the favorites, but Renfrow could find himself quite a few targets if he inherits the slot role vacated by Nelson Agholor, a WR3 for fantasy last year. \n* TE\n   * I was surprised at the number of times Ricky Seals-Jones popped up on this list. With him moving on to the WFT, this leads me to look at Cleveland\u2019s TE room. **Harrison Bryant** ought to be a slam dunk to make this team. He is young, talented, huge, had one big 2 TD game last year (and admittedly nothing much else), and he is behind a disgruntled Njoku and the starter, Austin Hooper. He has a great chance at making this team this year.\n   * The Colts have a muddled TE room, and Carson Wentz loves him some TE. Trey Burton is a free agent, opening up 47 targets. **Jack Doyle** will be the starter, but he doesn\u2019t demand a ton of targets, 33 last year. **Mo Alie-Cox** had a couple good games last year and has the size to be dominant. The college basketball player hadn\u2019t played organized football since he was a freshman in high school prior to joining the Colts in 2017. If he can really learn the position he has the measurables to make him a great player. **Kylen Granson** has also impressed as a rookie and the camp reports make it sound like he could be used more as a receiving tight end, where Doyle and Alie-Cox are more suited for blocking. All of the IND TEs show less than 5% Owned on Yahoo and any one of them could emerge and make this team. Sleeper shows Doyle with a higher %Rostered so he may be ineligible.\n   * **Will Dissly** has been great on the field. It just happens two games and then he gets injured. The Seahawks added Gerald Everette, but he hasn\u2019t received more than 41 catches in a season and is more of a blocker. If Dissly can stay healthy he could be the top receiving TE in what should be an improved offense. The aforementioned David Moore was the WR3 for the Seahawks and if no other WR emerges to replace Moore there may be a shift toward more 2 TE sets.\n   * Dissly\u2019s old teammate **Jacob Hollister** could also make the list. Hollister is competing with **Dawson Knox** in Buffalo for the top TE role and Knox hasn\u2019t really stood out. Whichever of the two emerges could be a decently consistent TE option in a top offense. \n   * Other TEs who could make it include **Donald Parham**, **Dan Arnold**, **Dalton Schultz**, and **Jimmy Graham**.\n* K\n   * I won\u2019t spend much time on Kickers, **Dustin Hopkins** is the main one to highlight. Yahoo shows him at 7%, Sleeper at 0%. Either way, he should be more highly owned. \n   * The double-doinker himself, **Cody Parkey** is also the presumed starter in Cleveland. If their offense takes a step forward their Kicker should be reliable weekly as well.\n* D/ST\n   * The currently unowned defenses per Yahoo are **Dallas****,** **Las Vegas****,** **Jacksonville****,** **New York Jets****,** **Atlanta****,** **Detroit****,** **Cincinatti**, and **Houston**. Basically, all the teams expected to be the bottom feeders of the league, and Dallas, who just has a bad defense. Dallas, Vegas, and the Jets would be my guesses to make the team but really they probably all will at some point. \n\n# Welcome to Fantasy Football 2021!\n\nAnything interesting I missed?

Throughout the season I write a weekly post reviewing the best unowned players that week. This has put the spotlight on a few players that we may otherwise miss. However, Fantasy Football is easy when you already know the scores. The real game of fantasy football is guessing the future. With that said I wanted to try out this introductory post so we can collectively look ahead to the Best Unowned Team for 2021. \n\nAs always, for the purposes of this post I will use %Owned from Yahoo and we will use 0.5 PPR scoring. The roster format is QB, RB1, RB2, WR1, WR2, TE, Flex, D/ST, K. The unowned team consists of players owned 5% of leagues or less.\n\n# Looking Back\n\nWhat better way to look ahead, than to start by looking back? I took over this post in 2018 and after 3 seasons I have noticed a few themes that show up on this team. \n\n## Here are the players that have been on the best unowned them the at least 3 times over the last three years:\n\n  |\\*\\*Rank\\*\\*|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|1|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|6|75|D/ST|\n\n|2|Jason Sanders - MIA|5|81|K|\n\n|3|David Moore - SEA|5|80.6|WR|\n\n|4|Atlanta Falcons|5|75|D/ST|\n\n|5|Dustin Hopkins - WAS|5|58|K|\n\n|6|New York Giants|5|58|D/ST|\n\n|7|Miami Dolphins|5|51|D/ST|\n\n|8|Buffalo Bills|5|48|D/ST|\n\n|9|Oakland Raiders|5|46|D/ST|\n\n|10|Josh Allen, BUF|4|99.78|QB|\n\n|11|Ryan Fitzpatrick - VAR|4|97.96|QB|\n\n|12|Zach Pascal - IND|4|77.2|WR|\n\n|13|Jeff Wilson Jr. - SF|4|75.6|RB|\n\n|14|Steven Sims Jr. - WAS|4|64.9|WR|\n\n|15|Willie Snead IV - BAL|4|62.8|WR|\n\n|16|Cairo Santos - VAR|4|55|K|\n\n|17|Devontae Booker - VAR|4|52.9|RB|\n\n|18|Jordan Wilkins - IND|4|52.3|RB|\n\n|19|Daniel Carlson - LV|4|49|K|\n\n|20|Kyle Juszczyk - SF|4|45.6|RB|\n\n|21|New York Jets|4|45|D/ST|\n\n|22|Gus Edwards- BAL|4|44.6|RB|\n\n|23|Kyle Allen - VAR|3|58.2|QB|\n\n|24|Dante Pettis, SF|3|56|WR|\n\n|25|Brandon Allen - VAR|3|54.04|QB|\n\n|26|Isaiah McKenzie - BUF|3|53.8|WR|\n\n|27|Hunter Renfrow - OAK|3|51.4|WR|\n\n|28|Tajae Sharpe - TEN|3|47.2|WR|\n\n|29|Anthony Firkser - TEN|3|44.1|TE|\n\n|30|Sam Ficken - NYJ|3|44|K|\n\n|31|Marcus Johnson - IND|3|43.1|WR|\n\n|32|Andy Isabella - ARI|3|42.7|WR|\n\n|33|Ricky Seals-Jones - CLE|3|42.3|TE|\n\n|34|Robert Foster,BUF|3|42.3|WR|\n\n|35|Brandon McManus - DEN|3|42|K|\n\n|36|Kalen Ballage - VAR|3|41.7|RB|\n\n|37|Dallas Goedert, PHI|3|41.5|TE|\n\n|38|Marvin Hall - WR - VAR|3|40.2|FLEX|\n\n|39|Darren Fells - VAR|3|39.1|TE|\n\n|40|Stephen Hauschka - BUF|3|39|K|\n\n|41|Ryquell Armstead - JAX|3|37.4|RB|\n\n|42|Brian Hill - ATL|3|37|RB|\n\n|43|Kapri Bibbs, WAS|3|34.7|RB|\n\n|44|Cameron Brate - TB|3|34.6|TE|\n\n|45|Wayne Gallman Jr. - NYG|3|30.7|RB|\n\n|46|Jacksonville Jaguars|3|30|D/ST|\n\n|47|Josh Adams - NYJ|3|29.3|RB|\n\nThe first thing that stands out to me are there are a lot of defenses at the top. This speaks to the difficulty in predicting that position. 4 of Tampa Bay\u2019s 6 appearances occurred in 2018. All 5 of Buffalo\u2019s appearances occurred in 2018. This year, both of them are being drafted in most leagues. Then you see Atlanta, Miami, NYG, and Oakland up high on the list and no one is rushing out to get them. The Dolphins have been underrated as a defense though, they were the 4th ranked fantasy defense last year. Perhaps they will join the ranks of drafted Defenses like TB and BUF.\n\n## Here\u2019s a list of everyone who has made the list each of the last three years:\n\n|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|Jason Sanders - MIA|5|81|K|\n\n|David Moore - SEA|5|80.6|WR|\n\n|Dustin Hopkins - WAS|5|58|K|\n\n|Miami Dolphins|5|51|D/ST|\n\n|Ryan Fitzpatrick - VAR|4|97.96|QB|\n\n|Zach Pascal - IND|4|77.2|WR|\n\n|Jeff Wilson Jr. - SF|4|75.6|RB|\n\n|Jordan Wilkins - IND|4|52.3|RB|\n\n|Gus Edwards- BAL|4|44.6|RB|\n\n|Isaiah McKenzie - BUF|3|53.8|WR|\n\n|Anthony Firkser - TEN|3|44.1|TE|\n\n|Kalen Ballage - VAR|3|41.7|RB|\n\n|Darren Fells - VAR|3|39.1|TE|\n\n|Wayne Gallman Jr. - NYG|3|30.7|RB|\n\nJason Sanders, David Moore and Dustin Hopkins are the only individual players (i.e. not D/ST) with 5 appearances on the best unowned team. \n\nDavid Moore seems to be a capable WR but has been stuck behind some combination of Doug Baldwin, Tyler Lockett, and D.K. Metcalf. Now that he is in Carolina, he is behind D.J. Moore and Robby Anderson, as well as camp reports saying rookie Terrace Marshall is outplaying him. My guess is more of the same, he\u2019ll pop onto the team once or twice this year.\n\nIf you use Kickers, I want to talk about Dustin Hopkins. We all have high hopes for McLaurin and Gibson. Logan Thomas and Curtis Samuel should be good too. All of this is elevated by the addition of Fitzpatrick. Hopkins could actually be a top 10 kicker this year if that offense takes a step forward like it should. Dustin Hopkins has been consistent enough to make this team each of the last three years and has been a top 10 kicker in the past. \n\nThere are 2 players here I don\u2019t want to see on the list this year. Let\u2019s do what we can to make sure that Ryan Fitzpatrick and Anthony Firkser are over 5% owned all year this year. With that said let me make a prediction: Fitzpatrick starts weeks 1-4. He plays poorly and Heinecke takes over. Fitzpatrick\u2019s ownership plummets. Heinecke starts for 4 weeks and then plays poorly week 7 and 8. Fitzpatrick comes out and lights it up after their bye in week 10 when his ownership is 2%. \n\nI also want to highlight Isaiah McKenzie. With John Brown\u2019s departure Gabe Davis and Cole Beasley are getting all the attention. You could do worse than throwing McKenzie into your flex, as he should benefit from those vacated targets as well. The presence of Robert Foster in 2018 also leads to the fact that this offense can support several WRs, especially as long as the run game is an afterthought in Buffalo.\n\nThe presence of Jeff Wilson on this list is not a reminder to take him in any drafts, it is a reminder that SF RBs do not stay healthy, and whichever are the top two any given week should return value. We also never know when one of the top two SF RBs is going to be Kyle Jusczyk. I am curious if Saleh and Mike LaFleur can replicate that RB Value with the Jets backfield. The RB rooms are even similarly built, veteran starter (Coleman/Mostert), Rookie draft pick (Carter/Sermon), performs well with opportunity (Josh Adams/Jeff Wilson) and others who can flash (Ty Johnson and La\u2019Mical Perine/Elijah Mitchell).\n\nKalen Ballage, how do you keep doing this? Every year you manage to make the team. He\u2019ll probably manage to do it again this year. Right now, it seems unlikely behind Najee, Snell and McFarland, but perhaps I should stop betting against Ballage.\n\n## Here\u2019s a list of 2019 rookies who made the list each of their first two years in the league:\n\nPerhaps more accurately, they made the list the first two years they recorded any stats, starting in 2019. \n\n|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|Andy Isabella - ARI|3|42.7|WR|\n\n|Dwayne Haskins Jr. - WAS|2|37.9|QB|\n\n|Darwin Thompson - KC|2|36.9|RB|\n\n|Olamide Zaccheaus - ATL|2|34.1|WR|\n\n|Byron Pringle - KC|2|32.5|WR|\n\n|Greg Ward - PHI|2|31.1|WR|\n\n|Reggie Bonnafon - CAR|2|28.1|RB|\n\n|Ty Johnson - VAR|2|26.4|RB|\n\n|Benny Snell Jr. - PIT|2|18.3|RB|\n\nThe name I want to talk about here is Byron Pringle. Mecole Hardman has not made this team once, likely because his ownership was always above 5%. Pringle however has been getting some camp hype and is surpassing Demarcus Robinson for WR3 in the high-powered KC offense. Pringle could be valuable if Hill or Hardman miss any time, and those speedsters tend to come up with hamstring issues at least once a year.\n\nOlamide Zaccheaus is another interesting name. Julio Jones is out and that leaves plenty of targets to spread. Ridley is assuredly elite this year, Gage should be solid as well but Zaccheaus has already shown flashes with Julio there and could be a bit more consistent even with the addition of Pitts.\n\n# Here are the top ten in total points for each of the last three years\n\n||\\*\\*2018 Team Member\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*Pos\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|1|Josh Allen, BUF|4|99.78|QB|\n\n|2|Dante Pettis, SF|3|56|WR|\n\n|3|Buffalo Bills|5|48|D/ST|\n\n|4|Brock Osweiler, MIA|2|45.76|QB|\n\n|5|C.J.

He was still being doubted going into the 2019 and even some into 2020, now he is a top QB in the league and getting paid to boot. He led Buffalo to have 4 players in the top 10 by score on this team (if you count the defense).\n\nI never understood the hype on Pettis, but now I see he actually produced some in 2018, his rookie year. I had forgotten all about that. I doubt he flourishes with the Giants, but I wouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised to see him pop up again on this list.\n\n||\\*\\*2019 Team Member\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*Pos\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|--:|--:|:--|\n\n|1|Steven Sims Jr. - WAS|4|64.9|WR|\n\n|2|Hunter Renfrow - OAK|3|51.4|WR|\n\n|3|Jeff Driskel - DET|2|46.02|QB|\n\n|4|New York Giants|3|44|D/ST|\n\n|5|Case Keenum - WAS|2|43.62|QB|\n\n|6|Ricky Seals-Jones - CLE|3|42.3|TE|\n\n|7|Brandon McManus - DEN|3|42|K|\n\n|8|Ryan Griffin - NYJ|2|42|TE|\n\n|9|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|2|39|D/ST|\n\n|10|Ryquell Armstead - JAX|3|37.4|RB|\n\nNo one here really jumps out to me. Sims is in a crowded room and changed coaches since 2019. Renfrow may be the most interesting. He may have as much chance as Edwards or Ruggs to emerge as the top WR option in LV. Any of them will be second fiddle to Waller though. \n\n||\\*\\*2020 Team Member\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*Pos\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|--:|--:|:--|\n\n|1|Mitchell Trubisky - CHI|2|45.06|QB|\n\n|2|Cairo Santos - CHI|3|45|K|\n\n|3|Devontae Booker - LV|3|40.8|RB|\n\n|4|Atlanta Falcons|3|39|D/ST|\n\n|5|Brandon Allen - CIN|2|37.02|QB|\n\n|6|Zach Pascal - IND|2|36.3|WR|\n\n|7|Willie Snead IV - BAL|2|35.3|WR|\n\n|8|Kyle Allen - WAS|2|33.86|QB|\n\n|9|Nelson Agholor - LV|2|32.9|WR|\n\n|10|David Moore - SEA|2|32.1|WR|\n\nBooker has been considered a decent handcuff option. His inclusion on this team each of the last 3 years speaks to that being true. However, camp reports suggest Corey Clement has been outperforming Booker in camp behind the injured Saquon. Either one could play early in the season and be valuable until Saquon returns.\n\n# So what do we learn from all this?\n\n1. Defenses and kickers are hard to predict, but there will always be good options to stream. \n2. Although the passing volume is low in Baltimore, Willie Snead carved out some decent games. I believe Hollywood, Watkins and Bateman are all more talented than Snead. Eventually one will emerge, and I think they will find some consistency this year at the WR position.\n3. Nelson Agholor could actually have a decent year. I suspect him to operate as the Patriots\u2019 WR1. He\u2019s been a fantasy WR2 a couple of times, and I tend to think that is his floor this year. The Patriots dealt with more opt outs than any other team last year. I suspect last year was an outlier for them, and they will return to being a good team. If Cam struggles again, the rookie Mac Jones has been promising in camp. Whoever emerges in NE should return value, I am guessing Agholor, Jonnu Smith, and Damien Harris will all be relevant this year, James White may return to PPR form as well.\n4. Muddled situations produce fantasy opportunity\u2026 If you guess right. See Jeff Wilson, Willie Snead, Darren Fells, Greg Ward. All of them had crowded position groups from the start, or an injury to a starter led to a committee. Consistency isn\u2019t there, but the opportunity to hit big for one week exists in these situations. If you are in a deep league and need a bye week fill in, these may be places to look.\n5. There are no bad players in the NFL, all of them are talented. If given the opportunity any of them can produce any given week. One broken play can lead to a long TD to Zay Jones. Ryquell Armstead could score a TD if given the ball on the 1 yd line for one play. In fantasy football it is consistency that increases ownership. The biggest predictor of consistency is number of touches. Included in this idea is backup QBs can still produce decent weeks.\n6. Lastly, a more meta deduction. The best unowned team is a far more valuable post in weeks 1 through 3 than later in the year. Those first few weeks can highlight players that will be featured in their offenses. By weeks 3 or 4, those players will be owned. Look for the players that could produce consistently. The ones with a path to consistent touches and the talent to capitalize. Later on in the year, be careful not to get sucked in by the one hit wonders. Injuries can propel backups to new opportunities but other than that, consistent players don\u2019t often emerge in the latter half of the season. \n\n# Who is making the team this year?\n\nI will start with the caveat that it seems %Owned isn\u2019t updated on Yahoo since the end of last season so I am also looking at Sleeper for %Rostered. It\u2019s hard to guess what the ownership will be during week 1. Bold players are possible inclusions on this team based on current ownership and potential points.\n\n* **QB**\n   * As I mentioned earlier, I would guess at least one of **Ryan Fitzpatrick** and **Taylor Heinecke** will make the team.\n   * **Dwayne Haskins** has found a way to make the team each year he\u2019s been in the league, and he is now behind an aging Big Ben. As an Oklahoma State alum, it pains me to say it, but the Rudolph experiment should probably be over.\n   * I bet **Davis Mills** gets a start for Houston this year, any starter that is less than 5% owned makes this team almost by default. Houston will be bad and a lot of people will leave him unowned, see Flacco last year with the Jets.\n   * Speaking of starters less than 5% owned, **Andy Dalton** will be the week 1 best unowned QB if his ownership remains this low.\n* **RB**\n   * **Salvon Ahmed** checks off a few boxes. Muddled situation, injury prone committee members, and has made the team before. \n   * Any SF RB with under 5% owned, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see **Elijah Mitchell** and **Kyle Jusczyk** on the team at least once this year. **Jeff Wilson\u2019s** ownership will probably dip below 5% just in time for him to fall into a 2 TD week as well.\n   * I mentioned him earlier, but I like **Corey Clement** to be the backup to Barkley and Gallman made this team in that role the last 3 years.\n   * **Kalen Ballage** is eternal. He will find a way to climb the depth chart for one game and then fade again into the ether. In case you have lost track, he is a Steeler now.\n* **WR**\n   * **Byron Pringle** will make this team more than once this year. KC offense has more meat on the bone than Kelce, Hill, and CEH can eat all by themselves. Hardman will be a benefactor, but I suspect Pringle to figure into the mix this year as well.\n   * Buffalo has consistently produced WRs on this team, this year I suspect that to be **Isaiah McKenzie**. Diggs, Gabe Davis and Cole Beasley should remain above 5% owned throughout the year, though Davis or Beasley could dip.\n   * With Julio moving north to Tennessee there are vacated targets aplenty in Atlanta. Ridley, Gage and Pitts will eat a lot of them, but **Olamide Zaccheaus** has been here before and is still unowned. I suspect Atlanta to not be great, so passing volume should be high. \n   * David Moore made the team a lot as a Seahawk and the Seattle passing volume is poised to increase with a new offensive coordinator in town. Metcalf and Lockett are rightly being drafted everywhere, but there is opportunity behind them. Look for **Freddie Swain** or rookie **D'Wayne Eskridge** to find themselves on this list at least once this year. Eskridge is currently on PUP so I\u2019d guess Swain.\n   * Oakland has also produced players for this list, and I\u2019d like to highlight **Hunter Renfrow** once more. The Oaklands WRs are young, and none have fully emerged. Ruggs and Edwards are the favorites, but Renfrow could find himself quite a few targets if he inherits the slot role vacated by Nelson Agholor, a WR3 for fantasy last year. \n* TE\n   * I was surprised at the number of times Ricky Seals-Jones popped up on this list. With him moving on to the WFT, this leads me to look at Cleveland\u2019s TE room. **Harrison Bryant** ought to be a slam dunk to make this team. He is young, talented, huge, had one big 2 TD game last year (and admittedly nothing much else), and he is behind a disgruntled Njoku and the starter, Austin Hooper. He has a great chance at making this team this year.\n   * The Colts have a muddled TE room, and Carson Wentz loves him some TE. Trey Burton is a free agent, opening up 47 targets. **Jack Doyle** will be the starter, but he doesn\u2019t demand a ton of targets, 33 last year. **Mo Alie-Cox** had a couple good games last year and has the size to be dominant. The college basketball player hadn\u2019t played organized football since he was a freshman in high school prior to joining the Colts in 2017. If he can really learn the position he has the measurables to make him a great player. **Kylen Granson** has also impressed as a rookie and the camp reports make it sound like he could be used more as a receiving tight end, where Doyle and Alie-Cox are more suited for blocking. All of the IND TEs show less than 5% Owned on Yahoo and any one of them could emerge and make this team. Sleeper shows Doyle with a higher %Rostered so he may be ineligible.\n   * **Will Dissly** has been great on the field. It just happens two games and then he gets injured. The Seahawks added Gerald Everette, but he hasn\u2019t received more than 41 catches in a season and is more of a blocker. If Dissly can stay healthy he could be the top receiving TE in what should be an improved offense. The aforementioned David Moore was the WR3 for the Seahawks and if no other WR emerges to replace Moore there may be a shift toward more 2 TE sets.\n   * Dissly\u2019s old teammate **Jacob Hollister** could also make the list. Hollister is competing with **Dawson Knox** in Buffalo for the top TE role and Knox hasn\u2019t really stood out. Whichever of the two emerges could be a decently consistent TE option in a top offense. \n   * Other TEs who could make it include **Donald Parham**, **Dan Arnold**, **Dalton Schultz**, and **Jimmy Graham**.\n* K\n   * I won\u2019t spend much time on Kickers, **Dustin Hopkins** is the main one to highlight. Yahoo shows him at 7%, Sleeper at 0%. Either way, he should be more highly owned. \n   * The double-doinker himself, **Cody Parkey** is also the presumed starter in Cleveland. If their offense takes a step forward their Kicker should be reliable weekly as well.\n* D/ST\n   * The currently unowned defenses per Yahoo are **Dallas****,** **Las Vegas****,** **Jacksonville****,** **New York Jets****,** **Atlanta****,** **Detroit****,** **Cincinatti**, and **Houston**. Basically, all the teams expected to be the bottom feeders of the league, and Dallas, who just has a bad defense. Dallas, Vegas, and the Jets would be my guesses to make the team but really they probably all will at some point. \n\n# Welcome to Fantasy Football 2021!\n\nAnything interesting I missed?

Nagy returns for what looks to be a make or break year for him.  Lazor gets a second shot at OC, and a big one with Fields/Dalton as QB. DC Chuck Pagano retired and they promoted safeties coach Sean Desai to DC.  \n2. The rest of mentionables: They hired Michael Pitre to be their RB coach. Michael Was the RB coach/lead recruiter for the Oregon Ducks.  Chris Rumph comes in as D line coach after a nice college career and broke into the NFL coaching ranks last year with the Texans.  A few other minor promotions from within etc.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Mitch Trubisky - Mitch Titties is gone and the ~~Andy Dalton~~ Justin Fields era begins.  We\u2019ll see how quickly Fields starts for the Bears. In the meantime Dalton can keep them afloat.\n2. CB Kyle Fuller - Coming off of a bad season by his standards but he is a tough loss to this secondary as he takes a lot of responsibility on. Replacing him is Desmond Trufant and uhh I\u2019m not sure which is very\u2026. Very not good.\n3. LT Charles Leno Jr. - A consistent starter that helped steady this line for years.  He\u2019s not an elite LT but he is definitely a good one.  Rookie 2nd rounder Teven Jenkins has big shoes to fill.\n4. DB Buster Skrine - More of a fill-in/depth guy but in conjunction with Fuller\u2019s departure this looks worse.\n5. WR/KR/PR Cordarrelle Patterson - A much bigger loss than people will give credit as he\u2019s a top 5 special teamer in the league and field position matters big time.\n6. RT Bobbie Massie - Spent the ends of both of the last 2 seasons hurt but hone he was on the field he was pretty good, he\u2019s 32 now so I get letting him go but important depth being missed when Leno Jr. leaves is tough.\n7. OG Rashad Coward - More important depth that had starts last season that\u2019s departing.  He\u2019s young though.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Andy Dalton - Shroedinger\u2019s QB, simultaneously average, unreliable, steady, and can win games.  Came in to be the starter until Fields dropped low enough for the bears to go up and get him. He\u2019ll be on a short leash if he starts the season and both he and Fields give Robinson a big bump, and I see Mooney as a stash until Fields is in.  Indirectly they both help out Montgomery since he will have some amount of less focus with Dalton and more volume initially then less focus if Fields is good.\n2. Edge Jeremiah Attachou - Some nice athletic LB depth\n3. DL Angelo Blackson - Very nice DL depth addition, he fits the role of rotational at best and that\u2019s exactly what the depth chart needs.\n4. LB Christian Jones. -  Another depth addition that was a starter but shouldn\u2019t be\n5. RB Damien Williams - He\u2019s not touching David Montgomery or Cohen\u2019s snaps so he\u2019s purely depth.\n6. WR Marquis Goodwin - The guy had a breakout season in 2017 then got hurt in 2018 and 2019 then opted out for covid.  The speedster will be behind Mooney presumably in his role.\n7. TE Jesse James - He\u2019ll push Kmet for snaps.\"\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. QB Justin Fields (R1) - He joins a team that just signed Dalton for 3 seasons but who knows how that\u2019ll play out.  Surely this kid will start with the way the league works today.  If/When that happens let\u2019s look at what we can try to expect.  Fields\u2019 had a plethora of different plays he excelled at in Ryan Day\u2019s offense at OSU. My understanding is that they did A LOT of repetition of a lot of different types of plays that would work at the college level.  There wasn\u2019t a heavy emphasis on one or two things like Lawrence. So being familiar with a plethora of plays is good, being able to study/learn and execute many different types of plays is definitely important, the big question is how much will the jump to the NFL affect him specifically?  While I\u2019m a believer in Fields long term success, I don\u2019t know if I fully believe he\u2019ll make the transition smoothly. We\u2019ll see though.  It\u2019s also worth noting that Nagy and Lazor employed different offenses for Trubisky and Foles so again it\u2019s hard to assume what to expect the offense with Fields to look like.  Fields had a connection with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson in 2020.  Olave is a typical Z receiver and very good route runner with decent size. Wilson was more or less a slot receiver that played outside as well. He also has decent size.  In 2019 he worked well with Olave as his primary target, but also BInjimen Victor the big target and KJ Hill an underneath route runner.  At Georgia he spread it out more or less and also had a connection with the TE. \n2. OT Teven Jenkins (R2) - Will have a lot of responsibility as a rookie but is scouted as NFL ready.  He\u2019ll be a boost to Montgomery I believe.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT/NT Eddie Goldman - He started for the Bears in the 5 seasons prior (with 1 injured season cut short) and his return will ensure their depth at the position and give them run d versatility in their schemes. \n\n**Assessment** *Well it\u2019s tough to really know what to expect out of the offense considering Lazor and Nagy are probably trying to custom fit one for each QB and haven\u2019t exactly had real success offensively.  Frankly I can\u2019t be sure we can trust them to produce an a great offense.  Either way we have plenty to be excited about because ARob and Montgomery immediately get upticks regardless of which QB starts the season because both are better than what they had last year. Mooney who showed a lot of flash in his rookie season has real potential for a sophomore breakout as well, I really like him if Fields gets in but I don\u2019t expect it right out of the gate.  Jimmy Graham probably remains the same tier 3 TD dependent TE at this stage in his career.  The defense remains very good as well but the secondary isn\u2019t as good as last season without Fuller.*\n\n#Lions\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. They fired Patricia (with good reason) and hired Dan Campbell, a character in his own right with a big time emphasis on toughness.  He was a tight end as a player and his history is as a TE coach (Hockenson giving me a hard-on). From 2011-2015 he was the Dolphins TE coach.  He worked with Fasano, Clay, and Jordan Cameron. Fasano was past his peak but hit his career high 5 TD seasons both of the years working with Campbell.  He notably coached Charles Clay to his 759 yard 6 TD season., as well as Clay\u2019s other decent year. Jordan Cameron wasn\u2019t really a talent and was phased out of the offense.  In 2015 he served as the interim head coach of the Dolphins when they fired Philbin after week 4.  The team went 5-7 while featuring Jarvis Landry as the main cog in the offense. Lamar Miller had a down season compared to the rest of the peak of his career.  Tannehill had a career high in yards with a good TD/INT ratio.  Parker and Ajayi were rookies supporting the offense along with Kenny Stills who failed to meet expectations after his time with the Saints. Instead Rishard Matthews had a bit of a breakout.  From there he went to the Saints as TE coach/Asst head coach from 2016 through 2020.  Unfortunately in that time frame he wasn\u2019t given too much top end talent at the TE position in that time frame.  Coby Fleener finished his career with NO, Ben Watson returned to NO, Josh Hill well\u2026 we don\u2019t talk about that, then more recently Taysom Hill but he barely lined up as TE, and last year he worked with 33 year old Jared Cook.  So here we are with a man likely licking his lips at the opportunity to work with top end talent in their prime with Hockenson.  He seems like he\u2019ll be a good coach and he said along the lines of how some coaches don\u2019t like hiring people who could end up replacing them but he didn\u2019t care he wanted to surround himself with as much talent and knowledge as possible and he did.\n2. He brought in Anthony Lynn who was the HC of the the last few seasons. Lynn was not a good head coach for a few reasons but he did lead the chargers to a 12-4 season in 2018 and had shown the other reasons in which he was hired for.  Before his time with the Chargers he was tied to Rex Ryan with the Jets and Bills as the RB coach and assistant head coach, he also was a RB coach for the Browns and Cowboys even before that.  This is probably a factor as to why the Chargers running backs were so solid through his tenure there.  A simplified take on how he did throughout all of those jobs is that when he left the run game always took a dive at all of those places.  It\u2019s also noteworthy that he helped the RBs on his teams find some of their more successful seasons.  You have to figure he\u2019ll place a heavy emphasis on a balanced offense and therefore I expect Swift to have some really nice numbers this season with Jamaal Williams as nice support.  The Chargers offenses also supported a number 1 receiver every year with viable number 2 in most seasons between Tyrell and Mike Williams successes\u2026 however the offenses had real talent and Whisenhunt was likely the mind behind the offenses and last year Steichen.\n3. For DC the team hired Aaron Glenn who had served as the Saints secondary coach for the past 4 seasons and their DB coach the season before that.   I\u2019m not entirely sure I get this one as the Saints had one of the worst secondaries throughout most of that tenure.  The key positive takeaway is that the Saints invested draft capital and traded for players in the secondary and he coached them up from being very bad to better.\n4. Back to the offensive side of the ball, the team also brings in Duce Staley to be Asst Head coach/RB Coach.  Staley has been with the Eagles organization since his coaching career started and became the RB coach in 2013, getting a bump in job title adding Asst Head Coach in 2018.  That 2013 season was McCoy\u2019s monster of a year with another nice one in 2014. After that he was given very little talent to work with in Demarco Murray and Ryan Matthews at the end of their careers, Blount, Josh Adams, until rookie Miles Sanders was decent.   Of course Sproles was around in support as well as Clement and Scott\u2026 those 3 guys are why I\u2019m excited for him to work with Swift as a similar player (and very much not like him as a player hah)\n5. Mark Brunell comes in as the QB coach. It\u2019s his first shot as a coach at the NFL level.  He\u2019s been the head coach at Episcopal School of Jacksonville, a prep school, for the last 8 years.\n6. Antwaan Randel El also joins the staff as the WR coach. He served as an offensive assistant coach to Bruce Arians the last 2 seasons.  \n7. They bring over a new Special Teams Coordinator, a new DB/D Pass game coordinator, and a few others on the d side of the ball. They retain their TE coach with good reason.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Matt Stafford - It\u2019ll be weird to see Goff in at QB in Stafford\u2019s wake.  Stafford had a 4000 yard season despite Golladay being injured most fo the year. He spread it to Jones, Hockenson, Amendola, and a bunch of others to get there.  \n2. WR Kenny Golladay - Missed a ton of time injured last season but the guy is a stud when healthy.  His departure along with Marvin Jones will be a serious gap to fill for Tyrell Williams (hurt last season), Brashad Perriman, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.\n3. WR Marvin Jones - Jones was the number 1 producer in the pass game last season and showed he still has game.  On his own his departure hurts but with Golladay being traded this is a really tough loss.\n4. S Duran Harmon - Starting safety that was decent considering how bad the lions secondary was in general.  I\u2019m not sure who they intend on filling that hole with.\n5. LB Christian Jones - Starting outside linebacker that had his struggles last year but losing a starter without a defined replacement isn\u2019t fun\n6. DT Danny Shelton - They lost him but they brought in what very much should be an upgrade to his last season\u2019s performance Michael Brockers who at 31 is going to have to prove he can do it on a DL without Aaron Donald.\n7. RB Adrian Peterson - It\u2019s Swift\u2019s backfield now and that\u2019s a good thing!\n8. TE Jesse James (FA) - Typically not worth mentioning but he\u2019s in here because his replacement is Darren Fells whom I like a lot as an improvement in the pass game.  I expect some 2 TE sets with him and Hockenson considering their WR depth.\n9. MLB Jarrad Davis - Lost his starting spot but still contributed\n10. Danny Amendola (FA) - On its own isn\u2019t a bad loss but again this is a guy who contributed to the pass game and is now gone.\n11. K Matt Prater - Prater\u2019s best days might be behind him considering his fg% was around 75% last season so this loss isn\u2019t a bad one.  However Randy Bullock isn\u2019t much better and lacks Prater\u2019s range, even in a dome. \n12. OL/OG Joe Dahl - Important offensive line depth that started 13 games in 2019\n13. OL/OG Oday Aboushi - Important offensive line depth that started 8 games last season\n14. DB Justin Coleman - Important secondary depth but on a bad secondary so he\u2019s replaceable but who are they replacing him with?  His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill.\n15. DB Darryl Roberts - Important secondary depth that started 5 games last season.   His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill as well.\n16. RB Kerryon Johnson -  See: Adrian Peterson\n17. CB Desmond Trufant - The vet was injured most of last year and struggled when healthy.\n18. LB Reggie Ragland - Important depth at the LB psoition, on its own it\u2019s ok but another case where someone else\u2019s departure it hurts more. The other in this instance being Christian Jones.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Jared Goff - Only time will tell if this move was the right one for the Lions. While Stafford is better and Goff has a serious cap hit getting two firsts and a 3rd in the deal makes it seemingly more than worth it.  This especially considering Goff has had success in the NFL, the question is how much of the success was his and how much was the system.  Either way Goff is coming over to a team without a true number 1 receiver.  They have Tyrell Williams coming off of a season on the IR with a shoulder injury and never proved he could be a WR1.  Brashad Perriman who presumably maxes out as a WR2, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.  That is a big step down from Kupp/Woods/Reynolds and previously Cooks.  So you have to figure Hockenson is going to have to be a huge factor for this offense to move.  \n2. DT/DL Michael Brockers - The vet comes in and instantly is a nice addition to the d line. His success has been next to Aaron Donald though so take it with a grain of salt since his responsibility is to hold it down while Donald tears it up.  The team doesn\u2019t have anyone like Donald but they did invest a 2nd and a 3rd round pick to the DL.\n3. WR Tyrell Williams - He\u2019s getting another shot at being a number 1 receiver after a disappointing 2019 and sat out 2020 with an injury.  He\u2019s got the freshlegs but who even knows what to expect.\n4. Jamaal Williams - Joins an offense that will have to have a heavy emphasis on the run and he has proven he can be a 1B. In this instance he\u2019s not going to be a 1B but more a complimentary back since he and Swift are very different runners.  If the run game is good in general he\u2019ll be a top tier handcuff.\n5. WR Breshad Perriman - After a disappointing start to his career he\u2019s proven he can be an NFL receiver in some capacity but he probably maxes out as a WR2.  His addition is important to a team thin an WR talent. \n6. TE Darren Fells - I kind of love this pickup - it\u2019s a subtle addition that could mean a lot to the offensive playbook as he has decent hands and is an okay route runner.  I\u2019m bullish in saying that I see him as a TE handcuff that has some production of his own the way Boyle was for Fleener on the Andrew Luck Colts offense.\n7. LB Alex Anzalone - The angel haired inside LB joins a team that needs depth and fills in nicely hopefully. \n8. QB Tim Boyle - He replaces Chase Daniel as the backup QB. I\u2019m not sure why they paid him as much as they did as the backup but hey he\u2019s a backup QB.\n9. K Randy Bullock - Maybe an upgrade to Prater in accuracy, not by much though, definitely doesn\u2019t have the power of Prater\u2026 but he\u2019s an NFL kicker.\n10. CB Quinten Dunbar - Much needed CB depth, he\u2019s dealt with injuries recently\n11. S Dean Marlowe - Purely depth with no startability upside but they NEED it in the secondary.\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OG Penei Sewell (R1) - Tough to say you found a deal at the 4th overall pick but the Lions thought they got one at that spot and they just might have.  This guy is going to pave the way for what clearly will be an offense that relies on the run.\n2. DT Levi Nowuzurike (R2) A much needed addition to the D line.  Figure he\u2019ll compete to start out of the gate\n3. DT Alim McNeill (R3) - Some competition on this D line for snaps will probably be a good thing.  It\u2019s clear what the staff want to do in bulking up in the trenches (Eagles model)\n4. CB Ifeatu Melifonwu (R3) - Much needed addition to the secondary. He could compete for snaps out of the get go.\n5. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (R4) - I think he plays like a slightly shorter/weaker Keenan Allen as he\u2019s shifty but his quickness is more a product of his ability to see/find space mores than his feet.  He very well could have an immediate impact on this offense since there isn\u2019t probowl talent in front of him. Not to mention his amazing name makes for great fantasy team names. He\u2019s a dynasty target for sure.\n6. LB Derrick Barnes (R4) - Another guy who might just compete for snaps from day 1.  I figure he\u2019ll be rotational but could earn it in the tail. End of the season.\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Geronimo Allison - Wouldn\u2019t be mentioned if they still had Golladay but yeah I feel like he has a shot to make an impact considering the rest of the names in that WR room.\n\n**Assessment** *Here\u2019s what I can say with confidence.  BIG buy on Hockenson with the value of TE in fantasy, and definitely invest in Deandre Swift.  After that I\u2019m really not sure what to say here.  The team\u2019s defense was bottom tier in 2020 and lost a lot of players that they didn\u2019t replace.. a lot think it\u2019s addition by subtraction and I can buy that considering they did add to the line but we\u2019ll see.  All eyes on Goff but the offense can\u2019t be totally inept outside of Hockenson and the run game.  Jamaal Williams is a great handcuff to own.  Amon-Ra probably won\u2019t be viable until later in the season in redraft leagues.  Tyrell Williams and Brashad Perriman are bust/boom drafts more than boom/bust.  Goff is in for a challenge this season.*\n\n#Packers\n\n- **Personnel**  \n\n1. Lafleaur and Hackett remain HC and OC and there\u2019s no reason to think they shouldn\u2019t be.  Mike Pettine was not brought back as DC after he brought them from pretty bad to pretty decent.  They hired Joe Barry who was assistant head coach/linebackers coach of the Rams from 2017-2020. Before that he was the Redskins DC.  He also had a 2 year stint as the Lions DC that ended abruptly after their 0-16 season.  Anyways his last stint as DC with the Redskins he did well enough.  He brought them from the bottom of the league to the middle in terms of defensive statistics for the 2 seasons he was there.  His time with the Rams is tough to gauge as an assistant head coach/LB coach but obviously he did at least okay.\n2. The rest are essentially some job title improvements and responsibility distribution amongst the staff that was already in place.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Aaron Rodgers - DEFINITELY PRE-EMPTIVE but if the guy is going pretty much not going to be your starting QB he\u2019s essentially gone.  Things could change but we\u2019ll see. If Rodgers doesn\u2019t play for the Packers I expect the offense and the team to fall apart fairly quickly.  Davante is still going to produce no matter who\u2019s throwing the ball but after that I expect a serious hit to Aaron Jones when the pass threat isn\u2019t as deadly.  Even if the volume is greater the quality is likely too much of a drop-off unless Jordan Love turns out to be as good of a rookie as say Herbert was last season.\n2. C Corey Linsley - The stud center signed with the Chargers.  2019 2nd rounder Elgton Jenkins will compete with 2021 2nd rounder Josh Myers for the job.  By default they will be a downgrade at least this season.\n3. RT Ricky Wagner (FA) - The veteran was released despite starting 9 games fairly well last season.  He did split snaps throughout the year though.  Billy Turner is getting the endorsement to step up for the position next season. Which is fine.\n4. RB Jamaal Williams - He steadily helped the offense tick throughout all 4 seasons. He never achieved the goal of being a starter but he was top tier as a 1B.  I do believe AJ Dillon will be more than capable of filling his shoes. If Rodgers is their QB I actually have Dillon as having a potential to steal starting reps from Jones.\n5. ILB Christian Kirksey - Starting LB who doesn\u2019t have a clear cut replacement so his loss will be felt a little.. however he wasn\u2019t very good last season so next man up.\n6.  QB Tim Boyle - Actually not a good loss considering the current shenanigans\u2026 however Blake muthafuckin Bortles signed with the Packers so that\u2019s a nice step up for their 3rd QB who very well could be their 2nd.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Blake Bortles - That\u2019s it. He\u2019s literally the only free agent they signed from outside the organization.  It\u2019s a good signing and it\u2019s probably due to cap issues.  He\u2019s a good signing but they have holes to fill. \n- **Relavant Draft**\n1. CB Eric Stokes (R1) - He\u2019ll push Kevin King for a starting position opposite of Jaire Alexander.\n2. C Josh Myers (R2) - He\u2019ll compete with Elgton Jenkins to start.\n3. WR Amari Rodgers (R3) - Likely an instant starter and an automatic late round flier if Rodgers plays for the Packers this season.\n4. RT Royce Newman (R4) - Good depth at a position that needed depth\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Devin Funchess - I guess relevant but probably not\n**Assessment** *It all rides on Rodgers, plain and simple.  If he plays then buy high on Davante, at value for Aaron Jones, definitely take shots on AJ Dillon and Amari Rodgers. If Aaron doesn\u2019t play then well\u2026 just Davante at what his new value would be and Aaron Jones if he falls.*\n\n#Vikings\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. A bunch of promotion and shuffling from within happened. However there is one important note.  Gary Kubiak retired and his son Klint is now the Offensive Coordinator.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything worth taking away from that.  Maybe someone who\u2019s a diehard vikings fan and goes to training camp can weigh in on what to expect different from Gary. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. LT Riley Reiff - A veteran of the game and still is an NFL starter but his prime was a few years ago.  They drafted Christian Darrisaw in the first round to replace him.\n2. S/DB Anthony Harris - He wasn\u2019t a standout but definitely a piece to the puzzle for the secondary.  His replacement being Xavier Woods could be a step down but Xavier was probably the best piece of the Cowboys secondary and he\u2019s joining a team that has more pieces around him.\n3. LB Eric Wilson - Another starter lost on the defensive side but Wilson left fans wanting more considering Anthony Barr is the guy he was filling in for.  Barr returns from the IR this year to start again, but how much time does he have left?\n4. DE/Edge Ifeadi Odenigbo - He also got his first shot as a starter in the NFL and disappointed last season. They brought in Stephen Weatherly to help fill the hole but they also drafted guys in the 3rd/4th this year and DJ Wonnum in the 4th last year so it\u2019ll be a bit of a competition.\n5. DT Shamar Stephen - He started 15 and 16 games for the Vikings the last 2 seasons.  Like Harris he wasn\u2019t a standout but he was a piece to the puzzle.  However they have Michael Pierce returning from the Covid Opt Out list to step up.\n6. K Dan Bailey - He had one of the worst FG% in the league and so the team moved on from him.  South African Greg Joseph is competing with UDFA Riley Patterson for the position.\n7. DT Jaleel Johnson - Another starter lost. This one however is probably more of a case of addition by subtraction\u2026. Also the fact that they brought in Dalvin Tomlinson to fill the hole is a HUGE improvement\n8. QB Sean Mannion - Kellen Mond\u2019s arrival meant Mannion was out as the backup QB.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. DT Dalvin Tomlinson - A big time pickup for the front 7.  Him with Pierce will help stabilize the heart of the D to give it the opportunity return to their former success.\n2. CB Patrick Peterson - The veteran still has talent and his addition also helps the defensive side of the ball.\n3. DL Sheldon Richardson - Another very nice addition to the front 7 to help the Vikings recapture the image they once had.\n4. CB Bashaud Breeland - a decent pickup for their secondary.\n5. S Xavier Woods -  As with many in the Cowboys secondary he had his struggles but he did show ability and he joins a defense with more pieces around him so I expect a nice improvement to both the front 7 and the secondary next season.\n6. WR Dede Westbrook - I think he has a good chance to compete for the 3rd receiver spot behind Theilen and JJ.\n7. Edge Stephen Weatherly - He got his first opportunity to be the starter and wasn\u2019t exactly what the Panthers were looking for statistically and he finished the season on the IR. He\u2019s in competition with some young guns for the starting spot.\n8. LB Nick Vigil - Important depth behind Barr.\n9. CB Mackensie Alexander - Important depth\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OT Christian Darrisaw (R1) - A day 1 starter at LT will have some growing pains but he\u2019s very talented.  Reiff\u2019s replacement has big shoes to fill.\n2. OG Wyatt Davis (R3) - He won\u2019t have to start out of the gate but could earn snaps\n3. QB Kellen Mond (R3) - I like him as a backup with potential in the future\n4. DE Patrick Jones II (R3) - Will compete to start this season\n5. MLB Chazz Surrat (R3) - Important depth behind Kendricks\n6. DE Janarius Robinson (R4) - Will compete to start the season\n7. S Camryn Bynum (R4) - Important depth behind Xavier Woods\n8. RB Kene Nwangwu (R4) - I think this was a draft based on measurables. He\u2019ll have 2 seasons to develop behind Cook and Mattison when Mattison will become a FA.\n9. TE Zach Davidson (R5) - He could end up being a receiving threat down the line but he isn\u2019t built to be an NFL TE yet. He has height but not functional strength/size. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT Michael Pierce - It was tough for the team not to have him available last season after bringing him in to steady the line but this year having him around along with Tomlinson will be huge, literally.\n\n**Assessment** *The team obviously focused on their defense in a big way but also their O line.  The main thing to focus on is Klint Kubiak and what that means for the offense. He\u2019ll need to command the same respect as his father.  Regardless it\u2019ll be safe to assume nice season from Cook, Theilen, and Jefferson.

I used [overthecap](https://overthecap.com/free-agency/) for signings which is good but not the best so I am sure I missed some.  I also used [football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) for stats, [Ourlads](https://www.ourlads.com/nfldepthcharts/) for player relevance and past depth charts, and [pro football history](https://pro-football-history.com/) for coaching changes.  I'm sure some mistakes were made along the way and I did this in my spare time over the course of the past couple months so some updates might have been missed as well so be gentle and I'll be happy to make edits/corrections because I'm not a sports writer, this was for me and I am happy to share.  \n\n#Falcons\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. Arthur Smith comes on as the head coach after it was clear that Raheem Morris wasn\u2019t the right coach for the job in the first year.  Arthur had some serious success as the Titans OC seeing as he made very productive players out of Tannehill and Corey Davis who had previously only shown talent but not an ability to put it to consistent use.  Obviously under his offense the Derrick Henry had 2 consecutive monster seasons as well.  Before he was their OC he was their TE coach getting the most out of Jonnu Smith and Delanie Walker.  There is a lot to like about the potential this guy brings.\n2. For OC they brought in Dave Ragone who worked with Smith on the Titans in 2011/2012/2013.  Smith was a defensive assistant/quality control coach then offensive assistant/quality control, then o-line/asst TE coach and Ragone was the WR coach then QB coach so they must have worked closely especially in that 3rd season.  From there Ragone took a season off before coming back to the NFL as an offensive quality control coach with the Redskins, followed by becoming the QB coach for the Bears from 2016-2019 and got upgraded to the passing game coordinator in 2020.  Because Matt Ryan is a completely different QB from Trubisky and widely more talented I won\u2019t try to compare and predict how the offense will run.  This especially considering Smith was a TE coach and they drafted Kyle Pitts.  As pass game coordinator they fed ARob, but that was an obvious move considering he\u2019s the most talented guy on the offense.\n3. Dean Pees also comes over from the Titans, making a lateral move as DC.  This is a great hire considering he\u2019s had success with the Patriots, Ravens, and Titans as DC before this.  However this is probably the least talented roster he\u2019ll have worked with to date so it will be a challenge.  At the very least I see some improvement coming from this hire alone.\n4. The QB coach they hired, Charles London was a RB coach tied to Ragone from his time with the Bears\u2026 again with Ragone as well as Smith in 2011 with the Titans.  I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d hire a former running back, who became a RB coach to be your QB coach but here we are.\n5. They bring in Justin Peelle fas TE coach which is important considering Pitts is going to be the 2nd receiving option on the team.  Peelle had great success as the Eagles TE coach over the years.\n6. They keep their WR coach, they hired a new OL coach who has had success at the college level and is getting his first NFL shot.  Another guy getting his first shot is their new RB coach Des Kitchings who has ascended college coaching ranks in a few different ways and is ready to make the jump.  They hired former Giants DL coach Gary Emanuel which is a solid hire considering their line has been decent. Frank Bush comes in as the LB coach and he\u2019s a great football mind to bring on.  As well as another potentially good hire at secondary coach with Jon Hoke who\u2019d been with the Bucs and the Bears before that.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. WR Julio Jones - Holy shit what a major loss to the team. It was probably the right move at the right time because of it\u2019s unavoidability but you know it still hurts. Ridley has proven he can be the guy with or without Julio and that will remain true but now the number 2 weapon is rookie TE Kyle Pitts. Let the hype train commence.  Russel Gage is going to have to step up in a way we haven\u2019t seen him do without 2 other receiving threats on the field at the same time for.\n2. RB Todd Gurley (FA) - The man\u2019s legs just aren\u2019t what they used to be and it\u2019s a damn shame.  He was still productive in the red zone but just couldn\u2019t break runs the same way.  Mike Davis is coming off of a career season backing up McCaffrey to replace Gurley here but I\u2019m not entirely certain he\u2019ll be much better especially behind that offensive line.\n3. LG James Carpenter (FA) - While he wasn\u2019t a great or even very good LG he was their starter and a veteran of the league.  At this point the only even potentially startable LG on the roster is rookie 3rd round pick Jalen Mayfield who also projected as a tackle.  \n4. S Keanu Neal - Essentially the sole bright spot of a secondary that had a lot of struggles throughout the entire season seemingly.  They also lost his counterpart at safety Ricardo Allen.  2020 4th rounder Jaylinn Hawkins will compete with Duron Harmon to the gap for Keanu.   Also Rookie second rounder Richie Grant will be in the mix.\n5. S Ricardo Allen - He struggled early in the season but got better as the year progressed and to lose him with Neal is not ideal.  To replace him they signed Erik Harris.  Also rookie second rounder Richie Grant will be in the mix.\n6. OL Justin McCray - Rotational depth that is an important loss when Carpenter could end up elsewhere.\n7. DL Allen Bailey (FA) - Rotational player on the defensive line. His loss feels more like addition by subtraction at this stage in the vet\u2019s career.\n8. QB Matt Schaub - Replaced by AJ McCarron as the backup QB.\n9. RB Ito Smith - Probably the weirdest hype train, but yeah he didn\u2019t live up to the bit of hype he carried and now he\u2019s a FA.\n10. S Damontae Kazee - Another loss to the secondary that wasn\u2019t good. He was hurt for most of the year.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. RB Mike Davis - At this point is the sole starting RB.  Qadree Ollison, 2019 5th rounder looks like his only current competition\n2. WR/RB Cordarrelle Patterson - A fantastic special teams addition and seemingly has some gadget viability.\n3. S Erik Harris - Looks like it could be a lateral move to Ricardo Allen but it\u2019s tough to know but neither were good last season is my understanding. \n4. DB Duron Harmon - Harmon has aged like a fine wine in the NFL apparently.  The true journeyman was given his first real opportunity to earn consistent snaps for the Pats in 2018, his 6th season with them.  He filled in as a starter to end the year in 2019. Then last year he was given his first opportunity to completely start with Detroit and played all 16 games.  He was above average on a very bad secondary\u2026 he\u2019ll have to be the same here if he starts.\n5. Edge Barkevious Mingo - He\u2019s rotational depth at this point in his career but ATL is thin at the position so it\u2019s a good pickup\n6. CB Fabian Moreau - Important corner depth that the team lacks\n7. LB Brandon Copeland - Important LB depth\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. TE Kyle Pitts (R1) - Looks like he\u2019s going to be the offense\u2019s number 2 weapon right out of the gate quite possibly.   Can\u2019t wait to watch fantasy owners reach way too high for him but then it still works out since he\u2019s an animal.\n2. S Richie Grant (R2) - He\u2019ll compete to earn snaps and could make a nice impact on the team\u2019s struggling secondary.\n3. OL Jalen Mayfield (R3) - Very possibly could end up starting at LG this year.\n4. C Drew Dalman (R4) - Important center depth\n5. CB Darren Hall (R4) - Important CB depth on a secondary that is putting itself together\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *I love the personnel hires, they potentially might have righted a ship that has been letting on water for the last few staffs. That being said with the players there just look to be more and more holes popping up for the players.  I think the defense remains bad for another season and the offense is incomplete and also isn\u2019t great.  That being said Ridley is still a stud and Pitts very well should be as well.  Mike Davis should be a viable RB2 on volume and Qadree Ollison is one of those true boom or bust grabs because of the potential for him to be the starter that few saw coming.  I\u2019m not a believer in Gage but I know many are.  I just don\u2019t think the o-line will be able to sustain more than Ridley on a consistent basis and I believe in Pitts over him.*\n\n#Panthers\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. Minor changes only.  The biggest change was hiring Sean Ryan to be their QB coach. Ryan was the QB coach for the Lions the last 2 seasons, the QB coach for the Texans the 2 before that, and a mix of QB or WR coach for the Giants before that. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Teddy Bridgewater - He may not have been the QB of the future for the team but he was solid despite the offense losing its\u2019 best player in CMC.  He sustained 2 1000+ yard receivers and Curtis Samuel had 851 yards on top of that.  Sam Darnold is given offensive talent for the first time in his career so we\u2019ll see how it goes as a replacement.\n2. WR Curtis Samuel - The team\u2019s WR3 but his role was so unique he won\u2019t be replaced.  He had 2 rushing TDs and over 1000 all purpose yards.  The team figured out how to use him more and more as the season went on.  To replace his production they brought in Seahawks receiver David Moore and drafted Terrence Marshall in the 2nd round.\n3. RB Mike Davis - He was handed the reigns for the first time in his career. That was done out of necessity but he stepped up in a big way for the most part.  His season tailed off but there isn\u2019t a replacement on the team so it\u2019s all McCaffrey and nobody behind him. \n4. S Tre Boston (FA) - The team\u2019s starting FS for the past 2 seasons wasn\u2019t as good as earlier in his career and they drafted Jeremy Chinn in the 2nd last season so they probably believe in him to step up this year. \n5. OT Russel Okung (FA) - Spent the last 2 seasons on and off the field for stints. The vet can\u2019t stay healthy.  Greg Little who spent the year on the IR takes his place.  They also brought in Cameron Erving and drafted Brady Christiansen in the 3rd round.\n6. DL Kawaan Short (FA) - Spent the last 2 seasons on and off the field for stints. The vet can\u2019t stay healthy.  2020 first round pick Derrick Brown filled in for his interior usage last year and a few guys rotated in for his DE usage, this year Gross-Matos the 2020 2nd rounder should handle those duties for the most part.\n7. MLB Tahir Whitehead (FA) - He outright stunk last season. He started the year as the starter and finished the year on and off of the field with injury but lost his starting spot. Denzel Perryman is going to be the one filling the hole.\n8. Edge Stephen Weatherly - After getting his first opportunity to start in his 5th season on a 1 year deal with the Panthers he leaves to return to Minnesota.  He was okay before he got hurt and finished the year on the IR.  Efe Obada and Gross-Matos filled in for him. \n9. DT/NT Zach Kerr - He was more or less package based and rotational but he was a serious run stopper. They\u2019re choosing youth to fill the role.\n10. LG Chris Reed - The veteran got his first go at starting and did decently.  There will be a competition to fill the hole but they may have to protect whoever comes into that spot.\n\n11. Edge Efe Obada -Rotational depth.\n\n12. FB Alex Armah - They brought in a UDFA Mason Stokke to fill the role.  Stokke was a LB and switched to FB in 2018 so he\u2019s not as experienced but he has the physical prowess.  We\u2019ll see if he makes the 53.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Sam Darnold - I was a big believer in Darnold when he was drafted out of college but I think at this point he\u2019s shown he isn\u2019t going to be the QB of the future.  As a stop-gap QB let\u2019s try to anticipate what we can expect out of Darnold.  We did see a small boost for Tannehill post-Gase and a very significant bump when he left Miami.  I just worry that we haven\u2019t seen enough attributes or traits out of Darnold in comparison to Tannehill that we knew had tools but never put it together.  Either way he has a 1/2 punch that he was never even close to with the Jets in CMC with DJ Moore and Robby Anderson.  Speaking of Robby Anderson he\u2019s reunited with Darnold so you have an instant connection there but talent always wins out so look to DJ Moore to continue his trend of taking over as the season progresses.  I won\u2019t delve into fit because it\u2019s always night and day from with Gase to without him.\n2. Edge/LB Haason Reddick - Came into his own in his 4th season, the versatile player joins some flash and youth. I think this is a very nice addition if he fits in.\n3. OT/OG Cameron Erving - He struggled with injury last year but the now journeyman will have an opportunity to earn more snaps on the Panthers line who has talent but also holes to fill.\n4. WR David Moore - He\u2019s replacing Curtis Samuel as the WR3 and will have competition with rookie Terrance Marshall Jr. but his experience should be valuable to the offense as a safety net.  He likely won\u2019t be viable as a fantasy player though.\n5. OG/C Pat Elflein - He got hurt early in the season but played every snap of the games he played to finish the year out with the Jets.  That familiarity with Darnold could be helpful but he really wasn\u2019t good but none of the line was\u2026 He\u2019ll compete for snaps/to start.\n6. DL DaQuan Jones - A super nice pickup to the front 7. If they find the right way to use him he\u2019s instantly going to make an impact in the trenches.\n7. CB AJ Bouye - He wasn\u2019t as good in Denver as they\u2019d hoped, getting hurt doesn\u2019t help that but now he won\u2019t have as many responsibilities even if he earns the starting spot and that\u2019s where he really shines.\n8. DL Morgan Fox - Important depth. He could prove to be better than expected just because he was overshadowed by the Rams study d line\u2026 or he could just not be good enough, which is why they brought others in.\n9. TE Dan Arnold - I speak for DHop owners everywhere that this dude was a low-key vulture last season in the worst way because you never saw it coming.  He\u2019s just a good TE and will force Ian Thomas to prove himself.\n10. LB Denzel Perryman - Not a very great pickup but they had to get an inside linebacker one way or another.\n11. CB Rashaan Melvin - He opted out of the 2020 season and joins his former teammate AJ Bouye and will have to earn snaps in what really looks like a deep cornerback unit.\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. CB Jaycee Horn (R1) - Joins a secondary that has potential next season. He\u2019ll have to earn snaps to prove himself but is in a good situation once he does.\n2. WR Terrence Marshall Jr. (R2) - I don\u2019t think he\u2019s super NFL ready but I could be wrong.  He\u2019s a big receiver with good hands but needs to work on his route running. He could have some surprise deep balls in mid season once he learns the offense but before teams figure him out.\n3. OL Brady Christiansen (R3) - Very important depth and lots of opportunity for snaps on the team so he could earn some.\n4. TE Tommy Tremble (R3) - Will be buried behind Ian Thomas and Dan Arnold this season at least.\n5. RB Chuba Hubbard (R4) - He comes in as a change of pace back. He is more of a home run RB and not as many tools in his shed as CMC (but that\u2019s true for most).  He could earn some touches to prevent CMC from having too much wear and tear but I\u2019m not sure about him overall.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team**\n\n**Assessment** *The personnel are in year 2 and I think ownership is cautiously optimistic on their hires. The team lost a key piece in Curtis Samuel but filled A LOT of holes elsewhere. They focused on the DL, the OL, and the secondary and I think they did a decent job. What matters the most is that it all rests on Darnold shoulders. What is his ceiling? How long will it take him to find it?  I obviously will trust CMC this season and assume he\u2019ll stay healthy.  I also believe in DJ Moore to be a viable player. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be reaching to draft him at all.  Robby Anderson you have to figure will put up consistent numbers and be a safe flex or WR2 play.  The TE position is a tough one to assume a lot of strength but it\u2019s tough to assume with a new QB.*\n\n#Saints\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1.  They lost their QB coach and their defensive back coach to other teams but it primarily stayed the same overall with some shuffling of titles and support positions.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Drew Brees (Retired) - The legend moves on to greener pastures and now it\u2019s up to Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill to fill the void. An impossible challenge for either but we\u2019ve seen some successes with both in some capacity.  The general belief is that it has to be Jameis for the most part but it\u2019s tough to know for sure with Sean Payton.\n2. Edge Trey Hendrickson - He got his first endorsement as a starter and he stepped up in a big way to break out. Marcus Davenport started there the year prior and will be back there this season presumably.  They also drafted Peyton Turner in the 1st round (In anticipation of Cam Jordan aging out soon).\n3. WR Emmanuel Sanders - He probably expected to play with Brees for the most part but he also expected to be the team\u2019s WR2.  With both Brees and Thomas both missing significant time last season (Kamara missing some time too). He was good but not great and that\u2019s fair. There really isn\u2019t a replacement to fill the WR2 void so again it all falls on Thomas and Kamara to lead the way\u2026. With nobody behind them at all.\n4. CB Janoris Jenkins - The veteran CB still played well last season and moved on to the Titans. They drafted Adebo Paulson in the 3rd round and have Patrick Robinson to fill the gap which is definitely going to be a step down.\n5. DL Malcom Brown - This is an actually pretty tough loss to the front 7.  He was good for the patriots for 4 seasons then was good for the saints the last 2 seasons. He doesn\u2019t really have a replacement but you can figure they\u2019ll change up the scheme to match the players.\n6. OL Nick Easton - He was drafted as a center but started as a guard in 15 of the 22 games played for the saints in the last 2 seasons. Cesar Ruiz, 2020 first round pick will fill in nicely presumably.\n7. TE Jared Cook - Normally losing a 34 year old TE wouldn\u2019t be a significant loss but without Sanders the offense is very obviously locked in with MT and Kamara as their 2 main weapons and Taysom Hill as a gadget.  He\u2019s replaced by Nick Vannett\n8. LB Kwon Alexander - The Saints traded for him mid-season and he was below average but okay for them on a rotational basis. \n9. P Thomas Morstead - While he didn\u2019t have the greatest leg, he knew the special teams system well.  He was towards the bottom in punt yards but was top 10 in net yards.  The signed former UDFA Blake Gillikin who was pretty good for Penn State but there were a decent number of punters with a better avg.\n10. TE Josh Hill - We know he isn\u2019t going to be a receiving threat but this is a case of without Cook this loss is more relevant.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. TE Nick Vannett - I suppose he\u2019ll be their receiving TE but my expectations aren\u2019t exactly high.\n2. Edge Tanoh Kpassagnon - He\u2019ll be a nice rotational player on the d line which needed a depth piece.\n3. FB Alex Armah - This is actually really nice for Kamara\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. DE Payton Turner (R1) - A good pickup for the future of their pass rush and doesn\u2019t have to start out of the gate but can compete for snaps.\n2. LB Pete Werner (R2) - A versatile LB with coverage abilities will come in and potentially be their starting Sam and very well could be.  It\u2019s a hole that needs to be filled.\n3. CB Adebo Paulson (R3) - A pick for the future that could also compete for snaps right away.\n4. QB Ian Book (R4) - A shot in the dark for a more conventional backup QB\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *I do like Winston and am a bit of a believer in him.  I think he has the talent to succeed with the coaching that is in place in NO. HOWEVER, he only has 2 weapons on the offense and a weird thing going on where Taysom Hill very well could be the starter.  Essentially the offense did well enough to sustain Kamara without Brees last year so you can assume he\u2019s a safe bet if he\u2019s healthy. Then Michael Thomas is a stud so you can assume he\u2019ll help carry whomever is the QB.  After that it would be a surprise if any of the depth guys emerge as viable fantasy targets.  TreQuan Smith should be the number 2 but I don\u2019t figure he\u2019ll be able to sustain much.  The FB signing is a big indicator of what the teams ants to do.  On the defensive side of the ball I expect a decent drop-off from the progress made in the last 2 seasons.  They did invest in the draft for the future but I don\u2019t see this year being the year that those investments pay off.* \n\n#Buccaneers\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. No significant changes at all.  The SB champs tried to keep everyone and they did for the most part.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. OL Joe Haeg - A rotational depth lineman. When this is your worst loss to your SB winning team that\u2019s a very good thing.\n2. OL AQ Shipley - Another rotational depth lineman\u2026 that\u2019s it that\u2019s everyone of even relative significance.  LeSean McCoy had 132 scrimmage yards in 10 games would be the next most relevant drop.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. Gio Bernard - Comes in to fill the void left by McCoy which isn\u2019t a significant one.  I think he fills a need in a very good way as a pass catching back. Fournette was their 3rd down back last season and had enough drops that this move is actually really nice.  It\u2019s the only one of significance that they made and it makes sense.\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. OLB/Edge Joe Tryon (R1) - A great addition to rotate in behind JPP and earn some snaps.\n2. QB Kyle Track (R2) - Could be the QB of the future, could be a bust but Brady was cool with it so nothing to worry about.\n3. OL Robert Hainsey (R3) - Nice OL depth\n4. WR Jaelon Darden (R4) - He won\u2019t see the field any time soon outside of maybe special teams since he\u2019s behind Evans/Godwin/AB/Scotty Miller but he\u2019s more of a gadget speedster so his skillset is different from them. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *See: 2020 Buccaneers.  Apparently Brady didn\u2019t even have the playbook down until closer to week 10 so.  That\u2019s when Mike Evans turned it up in a big way despite playing through some injuries (as he usually does).  It\u2019s also when AB joined the team.  I\u2019ll be curious to see how everything plays out in terms of touches between the 3 receivers and Gronk after a full offseason with the playbook.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes AFC South", "created": 1628554429.0, "players": ["Drew Brees", "Jared Cook", "LeSean McCoy", "Matt Ryan", "Matt Schaub", "Emmanuel Sanders", "Julio Jones", "Allen Bailey", "Patrick Robinson", "Janoris Jenkins", "Tahir Whitehead", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Barkevious Mingo", "Duron Harmon", "Rashaan Melvin", "Teddy Bridgewater", "AJ McCarron", "Mike Evans", "DaQuan Jones", "Tre Boston", "Ricardo Allen", "Michael Thomas", "Zach Kerr", "Brandon Copeland", "Josh Hill", "Jameis Winston", "Mike Davis", "Malcom Brown", "Denzel Perryman", "Kwon Alexander", "Efe Obada", "Derrick Henry", "Michael Thomas", "Keanu Neal", "Erik Harris", "Nick Vannett", "Robby Anderson", "Stephen Weatherly", "Morgan Fox", "Corey Davis", "Haason Reddick", "Curtis Samuel", "Jonnu Smith", "Tanoh Kpassagnon", "Fabian Moreau", "Damontae Kazee", "Alex Armah", "Trey Hendrickson", "David Moore", "Taysom Hill", "Dan Arnold", "Sam Darnold", "Ito Smith", "Marcus Davenport", "Ian Thomas", "Qadree Ollison", "Scotty Miller", "Derrick Brown", "Richie Grant", "Jeremy Chinn", "Jaylinn Hawkins", "Chuba Hubbard", "Ian Book", "Kyle Pitts", "Dave Ragone", "Jaycee Horn", "Joe Tryon", "Payton Turner", "Tommy Tremble", "Jaelon Darden", "Pete Werner", "Darren Hall", "Mason Stokke"]}, {"author": "Llaminated34", "created_utc": 1629387274, "id": "p7h6ic", "score": 1, "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that I think Hopkins is an unreal talent at WR, every year he does things that few other, if any, receivers can do. \n\nAs of now, Hopkins is rated as the WR5 on Yahoo putting him behind Tyreek Hill, Davante Adams, Stefon Diggs and Calvin Ridley and putting him above guys like Justin Jefferson, Keenan Allen, Terry McLaurin, DK Metcalf and AJ Brown.\n\nThe best argument for Hopkins being drafted this highly is what he did last year. Hopkins finishes 2nd in total targets and 4th in average targets. Shouldn't this make him a good value as the WR5? Well no, because that was last year and a common mistake in fantasy is the unconscious assumption that what happened last year will continue into the current year.\n\nThe Cardinals have some new toys to play that night leave Hopkins in the toy box a little too long. The guy I'm most worried about is Rondale Moore. We already have some evidence of Kingsbury forcing the ball into his hands through screen passes and handoffs. Moore is a superb talent who fell out of the first round due to injury. They also brought over AJ Green from Cincinnati who very well might be washed up, but reports out of camp suggest that A.J. Green is looking very impressive early on. Furthermore, James Conner has arrived in the hopes of becoming a far more consistent goal line back than Kenyan Drake ever was.\n\nHopkins only scored 6 TDs last year and all but 1 of them came outside of the redzone. Before Arizona added all these new weapons, Hopkins only converted on one red zone opportunity for a TD, meaning the Cardinals don't really look for him to score.\n\nIf you disagree and want to draft Hopkins because he's DeAndre Hopkins, I can't really fault you for that. He's an amazing player and I by no means think he's going to utterly fall off the map this year. I do however think you can get some much better value with your 2nd round pick either from a runningback, a receiver with enormous upside like Jefferson. The reality his, Hopkins will still play a large role in this offense. However, I think his upside is capped with all the talent around him and I want to take guys here that I think have a real shot at being the WR1 or an elite 2nd runningback.", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Nuk Hopkins is a bad value at his ADP, especially in half PPR and standard formats", "created": 1629408874.0, "players": ["A.J.

They matched up with the reigning NFC champions and came out on top. D-hop did as cards fans hoped and put up 14 receptions with 151 yards with a strong start.\n\n**Week 2**\n\n**Cardinals vs WFT**\n\n**Win 30-15**\n\n[Week 2 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpc4wqHCuk4&amp;t=486s&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals entered the week with high expectations and they expected a win. The receivers in this game found an even spread of yardage.\n\n**Week 3**\n\n**Cardinals vs Lions**\n\n**Loss 23-26**\n\n[Week 3 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NhEl0YACmY&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals entered the week with high expectations again but they were met with a defeat. This game was highlighted with three interceptions thrown.\n\n**Week 4**\n\n**Cardinals @ Panthers**\n\n**Loss 21-31**\n\n[Week 4 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWpTVkmWpR4&amp;t=20s&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals entered the week with, in my opinion, a slight advantage over the Panthers but ultimately were handed another L. Kyler Murray rushed for 78 yards, double the amount of Kenyan Drake.\n\n**Week 5**\n\n**Cardinals @ Jets**\n\n**Win 30-10**\n\n[Week 5 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D484ICiviTA&amp;t=111s&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals entered the week expecting a win. They left with a win. This game was highlighted with Kyler Murray throwing for 380 yards.\n\n**Week 6**\n\n**Cardinals @ Cowboys**\n\n**Win 38-10**\n\n[Week 6 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOp-Pl82Z2A&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals went into my favorite game of the season against the Cowboys. Kyler Murray went into this game undefeated in the AT&amp;T Stadium. He pulled off the win against an unorganized Cowboys roster, highlighted with a one-play drive to Christian Kirk for 80 yards.\n\n**Week 7**\n\n**Cardinals vs Seahawks**\n\n**OT Win 37-34**\n\n[Week 7 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bywrMfiALmU&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals faced off against the Seahawks in an intense OT game. This game was at the peak of \"Let Russ cook\" which was only getting scarier as the game went on. Kyler threw a pick and fumbled twice and Russ got jealous and threw 3 picks. This game featured two highlight plays, one of which, if you edit it right, is for Budda Baker, in full length, it's a DK Metcalf 200% effort chase down tackle to save a touchdown. In OT, our rookie, Isaiah Simmons wanted to show he's got \"it\" and while performing the second highlight play and picked off Russ to secure the win.\n\n**Week 8**\n\n**BYE**\n\n[Week 8 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&amp;ab_channel=RickAstley)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Week 9**\n\n**Cardinals vs Dolphins**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Week 9 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HknlyJVc7AQ&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals went into this game with about a 50-50 chance at taking the win. The Dolphins held the lead with a clutch Zane Gonzalez signature field goal(it missed) that could've tied the game. Kyler Murray ran his tuchus off for 106 yards.\n\n**Week 10**\n\n**Cardinals vs Bills**\n\n[Week 10 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQsemjPaCjU&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals entered the week with a lower probability to win. They came out on top thanks to 2 interceptions from the defense and after getting scored on in the last 3 minutes of the game, with 32 seconds left, the Cardinals scored a touchdown after a hail mary pass to D-Hop for 43 yards. That pass went on to be the president of the USA.\n\n**Week 11**\n\n**Cardinals @ Seahawks**\n\n[Week 11 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUCEAPc1Ub8&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals went into the game with the Seahawks-Cardinals-home-game-loss curse broken since they won at home earlier in the season. That didn't matter because the football gods declared that they must always go 1-1 against each other. Russ had 2 fumbles, none of which were lost and the Seahawk's defense got a safety. The game was highlighted by uhhhh [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZllW71Yc3j0&amp;t=18s&amp;ab_channel=HighlightHeaven).\n\n**Week 12**\n\n**Cardinals @ Patriots**\n\n[Week 12 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLgHkDBKZRY&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals went into the game expecting a win but in the end, they were beaten with superior coaching.\n\n**Week 13**\n\n**Cardinals vs Rams**\n\n[Week 13 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUn9qdWJfcM&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals went into the game with low energy and kinda looked defeated early. This game was particularly frustrating personally.\n\n**Week 14**\n\n**Cardinals @ Giants**\n\n[Week 14 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMU_IZuIr6o&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals went into the game expecting an easy win but I think I speak for everyone, with recent losses we weren't 100%. The game started off strong with Markus Golden, who was drafted by the Cardinals, went to the Giants, and then traded back to the Cardinals earlier in the season, getting a strip sack on the Giants. The game was also stamped by Haason Reddick(treat him good Carolina) who dominated the game with 5 sacks, setting a new franchise record. Also, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbMQiRdnQh4&amp;ab_channel=EthanThames1890) a cool clip that happened.\n\n**Week 15**\n\n**Cardinals vs Eagles**\n\n[Week 15 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNXXo5w0DFU&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nI really don't remember this game at all but according to ESPN, The Arizona Cardinals entered the week with an 80% win chance. The Cardinal's defense got a safety in the 4th quarter to give them the energy they rode through the game for the win.\n\n**Week 16**\n\n**Cardinals vs 49ers**\n\n[Week 16 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1WzShZBpBg&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals went into the game against a beaten-up 49ers team with high hopes. As the 49ers kicker missed every one of his three FG attempts, the game... just look at [this page](https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay/_/gameId/401220337) and see for yourself.. this game was just bad.\n\n**Week 17**\n\n**Cardinals @ Rams**\n\n[Week 17 Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW41nNoGWsg&amp;ab_channel=NFL)\n\nThis game was the deciding factor if we made the playoffs or not and the selfish Rams could've tanked and we both make it but noooo they just had to win. The Rams Qb, Jared Goff broke his thumb and was out of the game, this seemed easy but then Kyler Murray got injured as well. The second half started with a Rams FG, AZ punts, Rams FG, AZ blocked FG, then 3 punts to finish.\n\n**Personal Season Summary**\n\nOverall, our offense looked like a top 3 offense but then afterward looked like a bottom 3 offense, the defense as well. The name of the game this offseason should be consistency. Our new recruits in Isaiah Simmons and DeAndre Hopkins looked amazing. Since there was no preseason the Cardinals had Simmons seeing limited playing time at the start of the season and as he got more reps, he showed flashes of greatness getting chase down tackles, sacks, and interceptions. DeAndre Hopkins very obviously had a great connection with Kyler but in my opinion, sometimes had very poor routes being called for a top 2 receiver. If you disagree, have a [look](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/charts/list/all/arizona-cardinals/2020/11). The offseason losses of Haason Reddick and Patrick Peterson were saddening, but the Cardinals also brought in veteran players to help some of the holes we had. We finished as one of the most penalized teams and the addition of Rodney Hudson will greatly help with the false starts. The addition of A.J. Green will help with the inconsistency of a WR2. The addition of JJ Watt brings a great locker room presence and created a pass rush duo with Chandler Jones who missed most of the season due to injury. One glaring issue during the season was missed field goals when the team needed them most, this was directly addressed when Matt Prater was signed in the offseason. \n\n# 2021 Season Schedule and Predictions\n\n**Week 1 @ Titans**\n\nI think the game will get down to the wire but ultimately the running game and the WR duo of the Titans will take the win. \n\n**Week 2 vs Vikings**\n\nI think the game will be close but towards the end, the Cardinals will pull ahead for the win. \n\n**Week 3 @ Jaguars**\n\nThis should hopefully be an easy game, teams don't go from the first pick in the draft to a difficult team to beat in one off-season especially since this would only be Trevor Lawrence's third regular game in the NFL.\n\n**Week 4 @ Rams**\n\nWe always seem to lose to the Rams but this season, this season is different we will sweep the rams and eat their breakfast. \n\n**Week 5 vs 49ers**\n\nThe 49ers are looking to make a comeback and look how they looked in 2019 unless the injuries linger into this season. This game could go either way and depends on each team's health.\n\n**Week 6 @ Browns** \n\nThe Browns are looking to be a scary team, with how shabby our defense looked against the run last season this could be an amazing game for Chubb unless the new LB duo can step up.\n\n**Week 7 vs Texans**\n\nWe basically are the Texans at this point should be a pretty easy game against a team with a question mark over their QB and a defensive roster that made me look up to see who is on the defense.\n\n**Week 8 vs Packers**\n\nThis is looking to be a difficult game but the Cardinals have shown that they play better against better teams... maybe a repeat of the Bill's game but the more likely outcome, a loss.\n\n**Week 9 @ 49ers**\n\nSame odds as before\n\n**Week 10 vs Panthers**\n\nThe Panthers, I thought would be an easy win last year but they made us look silly without Christian McCaffrey. Hopefully an easy win but just as easily could be a loss.\n\n**Week 11 @ Seahawks** \n\nLife-long rivals and as a Cardinals fan in Washington, the most exciting game of the season. We usually beat them at home but last season we didn't either way, one loss and one win in this matchup as always.\n\n**Week 12 BYE**\n\nSleep time\n\n**Week 13 @ Bears**\n\nFirst game back after the bye against similar team rankings, 50-50 odds of winning in my opinion.\n\n**Week 14 vs Rams**\n\nSame as the first matchup\n\n**Week 15 @ Lions**\n\nHopefully a win against our rival, Jared Goff.\n\n**Week 16 vs Colts**\n\nOn Christmas day, primetime. We usually play well on a big stage and hopefully another opportunity to show EVERYONE what we're made of. The Colts are a strong team that could easily win but if we can do what we did last season, another win.\n\n**Week 17 @ Cowboys**\n\nWin.\n\n**Week 18 vs Seahawks**\n\nAnother tough matchup, but I predict a win because of a home game to end the season and this game could possibly mean making the playoffs or not.\n\n**Overview**\n\nNext season is a playoffs or bust season with HC, Kliff Kingsbury's job potentially on the line. If Kyler can make the jump as he did between his first and second season it should be a realistic goal and if the new additions of JJ, Aj Green, and Rodney Hudson all do as we hope this team could easily make it to the playoffs.

This was originally designed to be a ranking of the top 100  players in the league, regardless of position, for the upcoming season.  And while this has more and more become a comparison of resumes and  altered its criteria, in the spirit of what this was intended to be, I  listed what I thought were the very best players, in relation to how  good they are at their position coming into 2021. What I changed this  year was actually putting ratings on these players \u2013 sort of Madden  style \u2013 and one by one incorporating them into the list, while debating  back and forth when multiple guys shared the same number.\n\nThere are six names to start off with, who didn\u2019t qualify for my  list. I believe they all deserve to be on it, but I just didn\u2019t know  where to put them, because of how long it\u2019s been since we\u2019ve seen them  on the field, how often they\u2019ve gotten hurt recently or because we just  don\u2019t know if/when we will see them play again.\n\nI also added the 30 names that just missed the cut. So it\u2019s almost a  top 130, because I always have a tough time leaving those names off, but  I feel pretty good about the ultimate rankings that I put together  here.\n\nFor analysis, just click on the video, where I work my way from the bottom to the top!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbNE0KxkrwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbNE0KxkrwE)  \n\n\nThe official countdown premieres two days from now, but I\u2019m filming this here on August 4th  \u2013 just in case any players were to suffer an injury or some other news  coming out, that would change the availability of certain players. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n### Did not qualify:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijc078tlt4h71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c59e459a108cb587959379d6a88c53aa29ce94d6\n\n \n\nMichael Thomas \u2013 foot surgery in late July leads to uncertainty of when he\u2019ll be available\n\nDerwin James \u2013 only five total games over these last 2 years combined\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. \u2013 played in just 25 total games over these last four years\n\nDanielle Hunter \u2013 scary back surgery before last season even started, is something I want to see play out first\n\nMitchell Schwartz \u2013 currently still a free agent, who has hinted at possible retirement\n\nDeshaun Watson \u2013 for obvious reason, he\u2019s a top 15 player in the league otherwise\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# The list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezqd01ert4h71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=480f999d1fb85967293927e35f8ec71924b7c140\n\n \n\n1.

I used [overthecap](https://overthecap.com/free-agency/) for signings which is good but not the best so I am sure I missed some.

Nagy returns for what looks to be a make or break year for him.  Lazor gets a second shot at OC, and a big one with Fields/Dalton as QB. DC Chuck Pagano retired and they promoted safeties coach Sean Desai to DC.  \n2. The rest of mentionables: They hired Michael Pitre to be their RB coach. Michael Was the RB coach/lead recruiter for the Oregon Ducks.  Chris Rumph comes in as D line coach after a nice college career and broke into the NFL coaching ranks last year with the Texans.  A few other minor promotions from within etc.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Mitch Trubisky - Mitch Titties is gone and the ~~Andy Dalton~~ Justin Fields era begins.  We\u2019ll see how quickly Fields starts for the Bears. In the meantime Dalton can keep them afloat.\n2. CB Kyle Fuller - Coming off of a bad season by his standards but he is a tough loss to this secondary as he takes a lot of responsibility on. Replacing him is Desmond Trufant and uhh I\u2019m not sure which is very\u2026. Very not good.\n3. LT Charles Leno Jr. - A consistent starter that helped steady this line for years.  He\u2019s not an elite LT but he is definitely a good one.  Rookie 2nd rounder Teven Jenkins has big shoes to fill.\n4. DB Buster Skrine - More of a fill-in/depth guy but in conjunction with Fuller\u2019s departure this looks worse.\n5. WR/KR/PR Cordarrelle Patterson - A much bigger loss than people will give credit as he\u2019s a top 5 special teamer in the league and field position matters big time.\n6. RT Bobbie Massie - Spent the ends of both of the last 2 seasons hurt but hone he was on the field he was pretty good, he\u2019s 32 now so I get letting him go but important depth being missed when Leno Jr. leaves is tough.\n7. OG Rashad Coward - More important depth that had starts last season that\u2019s departing.  He\u2019s young though.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Andy Dalton - Shroedinger\u2019s QB, simultaneously average, unreliable, steady, and can win games.  Came in to be the starter until Fields dropped low enough for the bears to go up and get him. He\u2019ll be on a short leash if he starts the season and both he and Fields give Robinson a big bump, and I see Mooney as a stash until Fields is in.  Indirectly they both help out Montgomery since he will have some amount of less focus with Dalton and more volume initially then less focus if Fields is good.\n2. Edge Jeremiah Attachou - Some nice athletic LB depth\n3. DL Angelo Blackson - Very nice DL depth addition, he fits the role of rotational at best and that\u2019s exactly what the depth chart needs.\n4. LB Christian Jones. -  Another depth addition that was a starter but shouldn\u2019t be\n5. RB Damien Williams - He\u2019s not touching David Montgomery or Cohen\u2019s snaps so he\u2019s purely depth.\n6. WR Marquis Goodwin - The guy had a breakout season in 2017 then got hurt in 2018 and 2019 then opted out for covid.  The speedster will be behind Mooney presumably in his role.\n7. TE Jesse James - He\u2019ll push Kmet for snaps.\"\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. QB Justin Fields (R1) - He joins a team that just signed Dalton for 3 seasons but who knows how that\u2019ll play out.  Surely this kid will start with the way the league works today.  If/When that happens let\u2019s look at what we can try to expect.  Fields\u2019 had a plethora of different plays he excelled at in Ryan Day\u2019s offense at OSU. My understanding is that they did A LOT of repetition of a lot of different types of plays that would work at the college level.  There wasn\u2019t a heavy emphasis on one or two things like Lawrence. So being familiar with a plethora of plays is good, being able to study/learn and execute many different types of plays is definitely important, the big question is how much will the jump to the NFL affect him specifically?  While I\u2019m a believer in Fields long term success, I don\u2019t know if I fully believe he\u2019ll make the transition smoothly. We\u2019ll see though.  It\u2019s also worth noting that Nagy and Lazor employed different offenses for Trubisky and Foles so again it\u2019s hard to assume what to expect the offense with Fields to look like.  Fields had a connection with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson in 2020.  Olave is a typical Z receiver and very good route runner with decent size. Wilson was more or less a slot receiver that played outside as well. He also has decent size.  In 2019 he worked well with Olave as his primary target, but also BInjimen Victor the big target and KJ Hill an underneath route runner.  At Georgia he spread it out more or less and also had a connection with the TE. \n2. OT Teven Jenkins (R2) - Will have a lot of responsibility as a rookie but is scouted as NFL ready.  He\u2019ll be a boost to Montgomery I believe.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT/NT Eddie Goldman - He started for the Bears in the 5 seasons prior (with 1 injured season cut short) and his return will ensure their depth at the position and give them run d versatility in their schemes. \n\n**Assessment** *Well it\u2019s tough to really know what to expect out of the offense considering Lazor and Nagy are probably trying to custom fit one for each QB and haven\u2019t exactly had real success offensively.  Frankly I can\u2019t be sure we can trust them to produce an a great offense.  Either way we have plenty to be excited about because ARob and Montgomery immediately get upticks regardless of which QB starts the season because both are better than what they had last year. Mooney who showed a lot of flash in his rookie season has real potential for a sophomore breakout as well, I really like him if Fields gets in but I don\u2019t expect it right out of the gate.  Jimmy Graham probably remains the same tier 3 TD dependent TE at this stage in his career.  The defense remains very good as well but the secondary isn\u2019t as good as last season without Fuller.*\n\n#Lions\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. They fired Patricia (with good reason) and hired Dan Campbell, a character in his own right with a big time emphasis on toughness.  He was a tight end as a player and his history is as a TE coach (Hockenson giving me a hard-on). From 2011-2015 he was the Dolphins TE coach.  He worked with Fasano, Clay, and Jordan Cameron. Fasano was past his peak but hit his career high 5 TD seasons both of the years working with Campbell.  He notably coached Charles Clay to his 759 yard 6 TD season., as well as Clay\u2019s other decent year. Jordan Cameron wasn\u2019t really a talent and was phased out of the offense.  In 2015 he served as the interim head coach of the Dolphins when they fired Philbin after week 4.  The team went 5-7 while featuring Jarvis Landry as the main cog in the offense. Lamar Miller had a down season compared to the rest of the peak of his career.  Tannehill had a career high in yards with a good TD/INT ratio.  Parker and Ajayi were rookies supporting the offense along with Kenny Stills who failed to meet expectations after his time with the Saints. Instead Rishard Matthews had a bit of a breakout.  From there he went to the Saints as TE coach/Asst head coach from 2016 through 2020.  Unfortunately in that time frame he wasn\u2019t given too much top end talent at the TE position in that time frame.  Coby Fleener finished his career with NO, Ben Watson returned to NO, Josh Hill well\u2026 we don\u2019t talk about that, then more recently Taysom Hill but he barely lined up as TE, and last year he worked with 33 year old Jared Cook.  So here we are with a man likely licking his lips at the opportunity to work with top end talent in their prime with Hockenson.  He seems like he\u2019ll be a good coach and he said along the lines of how some coaches don\u2019t like hiring people who could end up replacing them but he didn\u2019t care he wanted to surround himself with as much talent and knowledge as possible and he did.\n2. He brought in Anthony Lynn who was the HC of the the last few seasons. Lynn was not a good head coach for a few reasons but he did lead the chargers to a 12-4 season in 2018 and had shown the other reasons in which he was hired for.  Before his time with the Chargers he was tied to Rex Ryan with the Jets and Bills as the RB coach and assistant head coach, he also was a RB coach for the Browns and Cowboys even before that.  This is probably a factor as to why the Chargers running backs were so solid through his tenure there.  A simplified take on how he did throughout all of those jobs is that when he left the run game always took a dive at all of those places.  It\u2019s also noteworthy that he helped the RBs on his teams find some of their more successful seasons.  You have to figure he\u2019ll place a heavy emphasis on a balanced offense and therefore I expect Swift to have some really nice numbers this season with Jamaal Williams as nice support.  The Chargers offenses also supported a number 1 receiver every year with viable number 2 in most seasons between Tyrell and Mike Williams successes\u2026 however the offenses had real talent and Whisenhunt was likely the mind behind the offenses and last year Steichen.\n3. For DC the team hired Aaron Glenn who had served as the Saints secondary coach for the past 4 seasons and their DB coach the season before that.   I\u2019m not entirely sure I get this one as the Saints had one of the worst secondaries throughout most of that tenure.  The key positive takeaway is that the Saints invested draft capital and traded for players in the secondary and he coached them up from being very bad to better.\n4. Back to the offensive side of the ball, the team also brings in Duce Staley to be Asst Head coach/RB Coach.  Staley has been with the Eagles organization since his coaching career started and became the RB coach in 2013, getting a bump in job title adding Asst Head Coach in 2018.  That 2013 season was McCoy\u2019s monster of a year with another nice one in 2014. After that he was given very little talent to work with in Demarco Murray and Ryan Matthews at the end of their careers, Blount, Josh Adams, until rookie Miles Sanders was decent.   Of course Sproles was around in support as well as Clement and Scott\u2026 those 3 guys are why I\u2019m excited for him to work with Swift as a similar player (and very much not like him as a player hah)\n5. Mark Brunell comes in as the QB coach. It\u2019s his first shot as a coach at the NFL level.  He\u2019s been the head coach at Episcopal School of Jacksonville, a prep school, for the last 8 years.\n6. Antwaan Randel El also joins the staff as the WR coach. He served as an offensive assistant coach to Bruce Arians the last 2 seasons.  \n7. They bring over a new Special Teams Coordinator, a new DB/D Pass game coordinator, and a few others on the d side of the ball. They retain their TE coach with good reason.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Matt Stafford - It\u2019ll be weird to see Goff in at QB in Stafford\u2019s wake.  Stafford had a 4000 yard season despite Golladay being injured most fo the year. He spread it to Jones, Hockenson, Amendola, and a bunch of others to get there.  \n2. WR Kenny Golladay - Missed a ton of time injured last season but the guy is a stud when healthy.  His departure along with Marvin Jones will be a serious gap to fill for Tyrell Williams (hurt last season), Brashad Perriman, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.\n3. WR Marvin Jones - Jones was the number 1 producer in the pass game last season and showed he still has game.  On his own his departure hurts but with Golladay being traded this is a really tough loss.\n4. S Duran Harmon - Starting safety that was decent considering how bad the lions secondary was in general.  I\u2019m not sure who they intend on filling that hole with.\n5. LB Christian Jones - Starting outside linebacker that had his struggles last year but losing a starter without a defined replacement isn\u2019t fun\n6. DT Danny Shelton - They lost him but they brought in what very much should be an upgrade to his last season\u2019s performance Michael Brockers who at 31 is going to have to prove he can do it on a DL without Aaron Donald.\n7. RB Adrian Peterson - It\u2019s Swift\u2019s backfield now and that\u2019s a good thing!\n8. TE Jesse James (FA) - Typically not worth mentioning but he\u2019s in here because his replacement is Darren Fells whom I like a lot as an improvement in the pass game.  I expect some 2 TE sets with him and Hockenson considering their WR depth.\n9. MLB Jarrad Davis - Lost his starting spot but still contributed\n10. Danny Amendola (FA) - On its own isn\u2019t a bad loss but again this is a guy who contributed to the pass game and is now gone.\n11. K Matt Prater - Prater\u2019s best days might be behind him considering his fg% was around 75% last season so this loss isn\u2019t a bad one.  However Randy Bullock isn\u2019t much better and lacks Prater\u2019s range, even in a dome. \n12. OL/OG Joe Dahl - Important offensive line depth that started 13 games in 2019\n13. OL/OG Oday Aboushi - Important offensive line depth that started 8 games last season\n14. DB Justin Coleman - Important secondary depth but on a bad secondary so he\u2019s replaceable but who are they replacing him with?  His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill.\n15. DB Darryl Roberts - Important secondary depth that started 5 games last season.   His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill as well.\n16. RB Kerryon Johnson -  See: Adrian Peterson\n17. CB Desmond Trufant - The vet was injured most of last year and struggled when healthy.\n18. LB Reggie Ragland - Important depth at the LB psoition, on its own it\u2019s ok but another case where someone else\u2019s departure it hurts more. The other in this instance being Christian Jones.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Jared Goff - Only time will tell if this move was the right one for the Lions. While Stafford is better and Goff has a serious cap hit getting two firsts and a 3rd in the deal makes it seemingly more than worth it.  This especially considering Goff has had success in the NFL, the question is how much of the success was his and how much was the system.  Either way Goff is coming over to a team without a true number 1 receiver.  They have Tyrell Williams coming off of a season on the IR with a shoulder injury and never proved he could be a WR1.  Brashad Perriman who presumably maxes out as a WR2, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.  That is a big step down from Kupp/Woods/Reynolds and previously Cooks.  So you have to figure Hockenson is going to have to be a huge factor for this offense to move.  \n2. DT/DL Michael Brockers - The vet comes in and instantly is a nice addition to the d line. His success has been next to Aaron Donald though so take it with a grain of salt since his responsibility is to hold it down while Donald tears it up.  The team doesn\u2019t have anyone like Donald but they did invest a 2nd and a 3rd round pick to the DL.\n3. WR Tyrell Williams - He\u2019s getting another shot at being a number 1 receiver after a disappointing 2019 and sat out 2020 with an injury.  He\u2019s got the freshlegs but who even knows what to expect.\n4. Jamaal Williams - Joins an offense that will have to have a heavy emphasis on the run and he has proven he can be a 1B. In this instance he\u2019s not going to be a 1B but more a complimentary back since he and Swift are very different runners.  If the run game is good in general he\u2019ll be a top tier handcuff.\n5. WR Breshad Perriman - After a disappointing start to his career he\u2019s proven he can be an NFL receiver in some capacity but he probably maxes out as a WR2.  His addition is important to a team thin an WR talent. \n6. TE Darren Fells - I kind of love this pickup - it\u2019s a subtle addition that could mean a lot to the offensive playbook as he has decent hands and is an okay route runner.  I\u2019m bullish in saying that I see him as a TE handcuff that has some production of his own the way Boyle was for Fleener on the Andrew Luck Colts offense.\n7. LB Alex Anzalone - The angel haired inside LB joins a team that needs depth and fills in nicely hopefully. \n8. QB Tim Boyle - He replaces Chase Daniel as the backup QB. I\u2019m not sure why they paid him as much as they did as the backup but hey he\u2019s a backup QB.\n9. K Randy Bullock - Maybe an upgrade to Prater in accuracy, not by much though, definitely doesn\u2019t have the power of Prater\u2026 but he\u2019s an NFL kicker.\n10. CB Quinten Dunbar - Much needed CB depth, he\u2019s dealt with injuries recently\n11. S Dean Marlowe - Purely depth with no startability upside but they NEED it in the secondary.\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OG Penei Sewell (R1) - Tough to say you found a deal at the 4th overall pick but the Lions thought they got one at that spot and they just might have.  This guy is going to pave the way for what clearly will be an offense that relies on the run.\n2. DT Levi Nowuzurike (R2) A much needed addition to the D line.  Figure he\u2019ll compete to start out of the gate\n3. DT Alim McNeill (R3) - Some competition on this D line for snaps will probably be a good thing.  It\u2019s clear what the staff want to do in bulking up in the trenches (Eagles model)\n4. CB Ifeatu Melifonwu (R3) - Much needed addition to the secondary. He could compete for snaps out of the get go.\n5. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (R4) - I think he plays like a slightly shorter/weaker Keenan Allen as he\u2019s shifty but his quickness is more a product of his ability to see/find space mores than his feet.  He very well could have an immediate impact on this offense since there isn\u2019t probowl talent in front of him. Not to mention his amazing name makes for great fantasy team names. He\u2019s a dynasty target for sure.\n6. LB Derrick Barnes (R4) - Another guy who might just compete for snaps from day 1.  I figure he\u2019ll be rotational but could earn it in the tail. End of the season.\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Geronimo Allison - Wouldn\u2019t be mentioned if they still had Golladay but yeah I feel like he has a shot to make an impact considering the rest of the names in that WR room.\n\n**Assessment** *Here\u2019s what I can say with confidence.  BIG buy on Hockenson with the value of TE in fantasy, and definitely invest in Deandre Swift.  After that I\u2019m really not sure what to say here.  The team\u2019s defense was bottom tier in 2020 and lost a lot of players that they didn\u2019t replace.. a lot think it\u2019s addition by subtraction and I can buy that considering they did add to the line but we\u2019ll see.  All eyes on Goff but the offense can\u2019t be totally inept outside of Hockenson and the run game.  Jamaal Williams is a great handcuff to own.  Amon-Ra probably won\u2019t be viable until later in the season in redraft leagues.  Tyrell Williams and Brashad Perriman are bust/boom drafts more than boom/bust.  Goff is in for a challenge this season.*\n\n#Packers\n\n- **Personnel**  \n\n1. Lafleaur and Hackett remain HC and OC and there\u2019s no reason to think they shouldn\u2019t be.  Mike Pettine was not brought back as DC after he brought them from pretty bad to pretty decent.  They hired Joe Barry who was assistant head coach/linebackers coach of the Rams from 2017-2020. Before that he was the Redskins DC.  He also had a 2 year stint as the Lions DC that ended abruptly after their 0-16 season.  Anyways his last stint as DC with the Redskins he did well enough.  He brought them from the bottom of the league to the middle in terms of defensive statistics for the 2 seasons he was there.  His time with the Rams is tough to gauge as an assistant head coach/LB coach but obviously he did at least okay.\n2. The rest are essentially some job title improvements and responsibility distribution amongst the staff that was already in place.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Aaron Rodgers - DEFINITELY PRE-EMPTIVE but if the guy is going pretty much not going to be your starting QB he\u2019s essentially gone.  Things could change but we\u2019ll see. If Rodgers doesn\u2019t play for the Packers I expect the offense and the team to fall apart fairly quickly.  Davante is still going to produce no matter who\u2019s throwing the ball but after that I expect a serious hit to Aaron Jones when the pass threat isn\u2019t as deadly.  Even if the volume is greater the quality is likely too much of a drop-off unless Jordan Love turns out to be as good of a rookie as say Herbert was last season.\n2. C Corey Linsley - The stud center signed with the Chargers.  2019 2nd rounder Elgton Jenkins will compete with 2021 2nd rounder Josh Myers for the job.  By default they will be a downgrade at least this season.\n3. RT Ricky Wagner (FA) - The veteran was released despite starting 9 games fairly well last season.  He did split snaps throughout the year though.  Billy Turner is getting the endorsement to step up for the position next season. Which is fine.\n4. RB Jamaal Williams - He steadily helped the offense tick throughout all 4 seasons. He never achieved the goal of being a starter but he was top tier as a 1B.  I do believe AJ Dillon will be more than capable of filling his shoes. If Rodgers is their QB I actually have Dillon as having a potential to steal starting reps from Jones.\n5. ILB Christian Kirksey - Starting LB who doesn\u2019t have a clear cut replacement so his loss will be felt a little.. however he wasn\u2019t very good last season so next man up.\n6.  QB Tim Boyle - Actually not a good loss considering the current shenanigans\u2026 however Blake muthafuckin Bortles signed with the Packers so that\u2019s a nice step up for their 3rd QB who very well could be their 2nd.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Blake Bortles - That\u2019s it. He\u2019s literally the only free agent they signed from outside the organization.  It\u2019s a good signing and it\u2019s probably due to cap issues.  He\u2019s a good signing but they have holes to fill. \n- **Relavant Draft**\n1. CB Eric Stokes (R1) - He\u2019ll push Kevin King for a starting position opposite of Jaire Alexander.\n2. C Josh Myers (R2) - He\u2019ll compete with Elgton Jenkins to start.\n3. WR Amari Rodgers (R3) - Likely an instant starter and an automatic late round flier if Rodgers plays for the Packers this season.\n4. RT Royce Newman (R4) - Good depth at a position that needed depth\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Devin Funchess - I guess relevant but probably not\n**Assessment** *It all rides on Rodgers, plain and simple.  If he plays then buy high on Davante, at value for Aaron Jones, definitely take shots on AJ Dillon and Amari Rodgers. If Aaron doesn\u2019t play then well\u2026 just Davante at what his new value would be and Aaron Jones if he falls.*\n\n#Vikings\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. A bunch of promotion and shuffling from within happened. However there is one important note.  Gary Kubiak retired and his son Klint is now the Offensive Coordinator.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything worth taking away from that.  Maybe someone who\u2019s a diehard vikings fan and goes to training camp can weigh in on what to expect different from Gary. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. LT Riley Reiff - A veteran of the game and still is an NFL starter but his prime was a few years ago.  They drafted Christian Darrisaw in the first round to replace him.\n2. S/DB Anthony Harris - He wasn\u2019t a standout but definitely a piece to the puzzle for the secondary.  His replacement being Xavier Woods could be a step down but Xavier was probably the best piece of the Cowboys secondary and he\u2019s joining a team that has more pieces around him.\n3. LB Eric Wilson - Another starter lost on the defensive side but Wilson left fans wanting more considering Anthony Barr is the guy he was filling in for.  Barr returns from the IR this year to start again, but how much time does he have left?\n4. DE/Edge Ifeadi Odenigbo - He also got his first shot as a starter in the NFL and disappointed last season. They brought in Stephen Weatherly to help fill the hole but they also drafted guys in the 3rd/4th this year and DJ Wonnum in the 4th last year so it\u2019ll be a bit of a competition.\n5. DT Shamar Stephen - He started 15 and 16 games for the Vikings the last 2 seasons.  Like Harris he wasn\u2019t a standout but he was a piece to the puzzle.  However they have Michael Pierce returning from the Covid Opt Out list to step up.\n6. K Dan Bailey - He had one of the worst FG% in the league and so the team moved on from him.  South African Greg Joseph is competing with UDFA Riley Patterson for the position.\n7. DT Jaleel Johnson - Another starter lost. This one however is probably more of a case of addition by subtraction\u2026. Also the fact that they brought in Dalvin Tomlinson to fill the hole is a HUGE improvement\n8. QB Sean Mannion - Kellen Mond\u2019s arrival meant Mannion was out as the backup QB.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. DT Dalvin Tomlinson - A big time pickup for the front 7.  Him with Pierce will help stabilize the heart of the D to give it the opportunity return to their former success.\n2. CB Patrick Peterson - The veteran still has talent and his addition also helps the defensive side of the ball.\n3. DL Sheldon Richardson - Another very nice addition to the front 7 to help the Vikings recapture the image they once had.\n4. CB Bashaud Breeland - a decent pickup for their secondary.\n5. S Xavier Woods -  As with many in the Cowboys secondary he had his struggles but he did show ability and he joins a defense with more pieces around him so I expect a nice improvement to both the front 7 and the secondary next season.\n6. WR Dede Westbrook - I think he has a good chance to compete for the 3rd receiver spot behind Theilen and JJ.\n7. Edge Stephen Weatherly - He got his first opportunity to be the starter and wasn\u2019t exactly what the Panthers were looking for statistically and he finished the season on the IR. He\u2019s in competition with some young guns for the starting spot.\n8. LB Nick Vigil - Important depth behind Barr.\n9. CB Mackensie Alexander - Important depth\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OT Christian Darrisaw (R1) - A day 1 starter at LT will have some growing pains but he\u2019s very talented.  Reiff\u2019s replacement has big shoes to fill.\n2. OG Wyatt Davis (R3) - He won\u2019t have to start out of the gate but could earn snaps\n3. QB Kellen Mond (R3) - I like him as a backup with potential in the future\n4. DE Patrick Jones II (R3) - Will compete to start this season\n5. MLB Chazz Surrat (R3) - Important depth behind Kendricks\n6. DE Janarius Robinson (R4) - Will compete to start the season\n7. S Camryn Bynum (R4) - Important depth behind Xavier Woods\n8. RB Kene Nwangwu (R4) - I think this was a draft based on measurables. He\u2019ll have 2 seasons to develop behind Cook and Mattison when Mattison will become a FA.\n9. TE Zach Davidson (R5) - He could end up being a receiving threat down the line but he isn\u2019t built to be an NFL TE yet. He has height but not functional strength/size. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT Michael Pierce - It was tough for the team not to have him available last season after bringing him in to steady the line but this year having him around along with Tomlinson will be huge, literally.\n\n**Assessment** *The team obviously focused on their defense in a big way but also their O line.  The main thing to focus on is Klint Kubiak and what that means for the offense. He\u2019ll need to command the same respect as his father.  Regardless it\u2019ll be safe to assume nice season from Cook, Theilen, and Jefferson. They don\u2019t really have a TE for the sake of moving the ball so it\u2019s those 3 alone that will be the workhorses as they have been.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes NFC North", "created": 1628554151.0, "players": ["Aaron Rodgers", "Adrian Peterson", "Chase Daniel", "Danny Amendola", "Jared Cook", "Matt Prater", "Jimmy Graham", "Patrick Peterson", "Andy Dalton", "Buster Skrine", "Dan Bailey", "Lamar Miller", "Michael Brockers", "Randy Bullock", "Kenny Stills", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Keenan Allen", "Sheldon Richardson", "Desmond Trufant", "Blake Bortles", "Jarvis Landry", "Anthony Barr", "Christian Jones", "Aaron Donald", "Kyle Fuller", "Christian Kirksey", "Bashaud Breeland", "Shamar Stephen", "Damien Williams", "Josh Hill", "Darren Fells", "Danny Shelton", "Eddie Goldman", "Devin Funchess", "Sean Mannion", "Jesse James", "Breshad Perriman", "Darryl Roberts", "Angelo Blackson", "Dean Marlowe", "Tyrell Williams", "Justin Coleman", "Anthony Harris", "Jared Goff", "Mackensie Alexander", "Reggie Ragland", "Nick Vigil", "Geronimo Allison", "Stephen Weatherly", "Michael Pierce", "Mike Williams", "Jamaal Williams", "Dede Westbrook", "Jarrad Davis", "Kevin King", "Kenny Golladay", "Xavier Woods", "Dalvin Tomlinson", "Aaron Jones", "Ifeadi Odenigbo", "Jaleel Johnson", "Eric Wilson", "Alex Anzalone", "Taysom Hill", "Kerryon Johnson", "Josh Adams", "Christian Kirk", "Jaire Alexander", "Greg Joseph", "Tim Boyle", "David Montgomery", "Miles Sanders", "Jordan Love", "AJ Dillon", "Kellen Mond", "Janarius Robinson", "Binjimen Victor", "Justin Fields", "Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Chris Olave", "Amari Rodgers", "Dan Campbell", "Marvin Jones", "Duce Staley", "Aaron Glenn", "Mike Williams", "Patrick Jones II", "Eric Stokes", "Camryn Bynum", "Alim McNeill", "Ifeatu Melifonwu", "Garrett Wilson", "Derrick Barnes", "Kene Nwangwu", "Patrick Jones II", "Riley Patterson", "Zach Davidson"]}, {"author": "slightlyillegal", "created_utc": 1628266992, "id": "oza15x", "score": 1, "selftext": "[**Denver Broncos**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/)\n\nAFC West\n\n1 Kansas City Chiefs (14-2)\n\n2 Las Vegas Raiders (8-8)\n\n3 Los Angeles Chargers (7-9)\n\n**4 Denver Broncos (5-11)**\n\n\\---\n\n# Front Office\n\n**The Duke\u2019s Upward Fall**\n\nLook, I don\u2019t care what anyone says. John Elway is the most important figure in Denver Broncos history. Without John, we don\u2019t have a single Lombardi. Without John, we\u2019d be without of one of the most impressive drives in NFL lore. Without John, I might be a *baseball* fan. Yuck. While the past five years have been\u2026what\u2019s a nice word for it\u2026unpalatable\u2026John Elway was an objectively great executive for this team. After a near-decade of purgatory (2005\u2019s mustachioed glory notwithstanding), Elway brought this franchise back into relevance. He secured one of the league\u2019s most historically pivotal free agents in Peyton Manning, he architected on of the league\u2019s most prolific offenses, he completely reinvented the defensive side of the roster after that prolific offense took a giant shit on itself in front of 111.5 million viewers, and he managed to do it all while [permanently blackout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqR8AEuTe4g). After years of trying and failing to find himself in a quarterback, John made the wise decision to promote himself\u2014now just the President of Football Operations\u2014and usher in a new era in Broncos Front Office personnel. Which brings us to\u2026\n\n**General Paton Takes Over**\n\nThe supposed most-coveted GM candidate in the NFL. A man who turned down prior interview requests several times, and an overall [*cool*](https://www.startribune.com/george-paton-vikings-broncos-general-manager/600010097/) guy\u2014George Paton. A 14-year Viking vet, George Paton is widely regarded as one of the smartest NFL execs around. He worked his way up to management from a lowly scouting position and prides himself on getting eyes on players as often as possible. During his time in Minnesota, he\u2019s credited with helping the team acquire 22 Pro Bowl players in total. Once Paton relieved John of his GMing duties, he immediately got to work digging into the team, its current roster, its needs, and its fans. I\u2019ll get into Paton\u2019s moves a bit more later in the post but, suffice to say\u2014we like George Paton so far. And you know what George Paton likes? DBs.\n\n**Kelly Kleine Makes History**\n\nIn a very cool early move, Paton brought with him one of the league\u2019s foremost female NFL executives, and promoted her to Executive Director of Football Operations. Having spent a decade with the Vikings, Kleine managed both collegiate and pro scouting, along with draft operations. This move marks the highest-ranking female scouting hire in NFL history. Go Kelly. Go George. Way cool.\n\n**Annnnnnnd\u2026the Ownership Situation**\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into it, but the team may be up for sale in the coming months/year. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t get sold to Bezos. I have no interest in that (literal) knob owning our team. RIP Pat. We miss you immensely.\n\n\\---\n\n# Coaching Room\n\n// NOTABLE DEPARTURES //\n\n**GREEK**\n\nGREEEEEEEEEEEK. After 45 years\u2014yes, you read that right\u2014with the Denver Broncos, Steve Antonopulous has officially retired. Greek\u2019s impact has been felt through eight Super Bowl appearances, ten General Managers, and three and a half team owners. As the team\u2019s Head Trainer and Get-Better Czar, Greek was beloved by *all* in Mile High and across Broncos Country. [This video](https://www.denverbroncos.com/video/salute-to-greek-colleagues-friends-and-broncos-players-congratulate-antonopulos-) sums up Greek, the man. No words can truly sum up Greek\u2019s impact on this team.\n\n// CURRENT STAFF //\n\n**Vic Fangio \u2014 HC**\n\nYou know, Vic\u2019s had a bit of a rough go at it in his head coaching tenure. He\u2019s got a 12-20 record. He\u2019s missed the playoffs each year. He\u2019s made some seriously questionable play clock decisions. His defenses haven\u2019t lived up to his time in Chicago. All that said, Vic\u2019s been dealt a bit of a shit hand. His quarterback play has been abysmal. Practically a third of his team was injured last year, including 11 on IR by October. I\u2019m not ready to throw in the towel on Vic just yet. This season will be pivotal\u2014does George Paton burn it all down after missing the playoffs for a third straight year, or does Vic hang his hat on (what should be) a historically great defense, despite spotty QB play? Yes, we\u2019re resigned to that. It\u2019s fine.\n\n**Pat Shurmur \u2014 OC**\n\nPat, on the other hand, I\u2019m totally cool with letting go. Did you know that Drew Lock has one of the league\u2019s highest completions rates when rolling out of the pocket in play action? And guess which team has one of the league\u2019s lowest play action passing percentages? Pat Shurmur is supposed to be a quarterback whisperer, but he was unable to un-lock consistency at the position last year. Here\u2019s to hoping that Drew\u2019s first-ever second-year system sticks. If not, I\u2019m all for burning it down.\n\n**Ed Donatell \u2014 DC**\n\nI have no idea how much of the Defense\u2019s marginal success is due to Ed\u2019s or Vic\u2019s brilliance, but we\u2019ve managed to not suck despite having one of the league\u2019s worst offenses two years running, and, even more impressively, we somehow held up the league\u2019s 13th-best defense (DVOA) despite fielding practice squad corners and matchsticks on the line. The players love Ed, so Ed\u2019s cool in my book.\n\n**Tom McMahon \u2014 ST**\n\nWe Broncos fans don\u2019t love Tom McMahon. To be honest, I don\u2019t know enough about Special Teams coaching to give a reasonable analysis as to why we don\u2019t like him. There was some stuff about asking punters to change the way they kick. That seems weird. We\u2019ve also had some [boneheaded mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mub1h-vpB5c). He\u2019s certainly not getting invited to dinner by Belichick anytime soon.\n\n**Remaining (Primary) Staff**\n\n|POS|COACH|\n|:-|:-|\n|**QB**|Mike Shula|\n|**RB**|Curtis Modkins|\n|**WR**|Zach Azzanni|\n|**TE**|Wade Harman|\n|**OL**|Mike Munchak|\n|**DL**|Bill Kollar|\n|**LB**|Reggie Herring|\n|**OLB**|John Pagano|\n|**DB**|Christian Parker|\n|**S&amp;C**|Loren Landow|\n\n\\---\n\n# Free Agency\n\n**Players Lost/Cut/Traded**\n\n|POS|PLAYER|NEW TEAM|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**QB**|Jeff Driskel|Houston Texans|\n|**RB**|Phillip Lindsay|Houston Texans|\n|**WR**|DaeSean Hamilton|Free Agent|\n|**TE**|Jake Butt|RETIRED|\n|**TE**|Nick Vannett|New Orleans Saints|\n|**RT**|Ju-Wuan James|Baltimore Ravens|\n|**OT**|Demar Dotson|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|\n|**OG**|Elijah Wilkinson|Chicago Bears|\n|**EDGE**|Jeremiah Attaochu|Chicago Bears|\n|**EDGE**|Anthony Chickillo|RETIRED|\n|**DE**|Jurrell Casey|Free Agent|\n|**DE**|DeMarcus Walker|Houston Texans|\n|**DE**|Joel Heath|Detroit Lions|\n|**DT**|Sylvester Williams|Free Agent|\n|**ILB**|Joseph Jones|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|\n|**CB**|A.J.

Phillip Linsday was the juice. A pure, unbridled electricity that kept this corpse of an offense animated long enough to save Broncos Country from fatal liver disease season-in and season-out. He has the mane of a lion and the heart of an even bigger lion. Sure, he wasn\u2019t too big himself, but boy did he play big. Kid could hit. Like, [seriously hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdXdMFWewF4). Despite his small frame, Lindsay never shied away from contact and always bounced right back up. He\u2019s a physical specimen who can break off a homerun on [any given play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvUfzQlgC1I). He\u2019s shifty. [He likes smelling salts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hxv5uvtgFU). He\u2019s everything you\u2019d want in a runner, except for, well, you know, the kind of body that would stay healthy for a full season. Broncos Country loved Phillip Lindsay and we\u2019re very sorry to see him go. Particularly to the Texans. God save him.\n\n**Ja\u2019Wuan James Packs His (Unreasonably Hefty) Bags**\n\nThis one\u2026doesn\u2019t make me sad. This was far and away John\u2019s worst Free Agent signing as the Broncos\u2019 GM. 63 snaps. This man made $17MM for just 63 snaps. I\u2019m not heartless\u2014I do feel for the guy, having torn his Achilles in May. I wish him a speedy recovery. But dear lord, if the Ravens expect to get anything near a full season out of him\u2026\\*wew\\* The James signing marked one of the worst periods of Right Tackle play in Broncos history, a position we\u2019ve still yet to find a solid solution for. Thank god Bolles figured out how to play Left Tackle, or we might have had utterly terrible QB play last season. Oh, wait.\n\n**No Room for BaeSean**\n\nThough there was initial trade interest in DaeSean Hamilton, the Broncos ultimately waived the fourth-year receiver after another below-starting season on the depth chart. With two promising rookie receivers drafted last year, along with the emergence of Tim Patrick as a viable WR2, there simply wasn\u2019t enough room for DaeSean on the roster anymore. To add injury to insult, Hamilton tore his ACL during an offseason workout, effectively squashing any hope of rostering this year.\n\n**2020 FA Woes**\n\nBouye, was 2020 a tough year for injuries (ba-dum tss). After a promising Free Agency period that saw splashy defensive additions like DE Jurrell Casey and CB A.J. Bouye, the Broncos struggled to keep their (well-paid) stars on the field. As we all know, the best ability is availability\u2014both Casey and Bouye became cap casualties at the head of the new league year.\n\n**Players Re-Signed/Tagged/Extended**\n\n|POS|PLAYER|CONTRACT|TOTAL|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**WR**|Tim Patrick|1 Year|$3.38MM|\n|**WR**|Diontae (God Peed) Spencer|2 Year|$1.52MM|\n|**OT**|Calvin Anderson|1 Year|$0.85MM|\n|**EDGE**|Von Miller|5th Year Option|$114.5MM|\n|**DT**|Shelby Harris|3 Year|$27MM|\n|**ILB**|Alexander Johnson|1 Year|$3.38MM|\n|**SS**|Kareem Jackson|1 Year|$5MM|\n|**FS**|Justin Simmons|4 Year|$61MM|\n|**FS**|Trey Marshall|1 Year|$0.66MM|\n\n// NOTABLE KEEPATURES //\n\n**Von Miller in Six**\n\nVon\u2019s back, baby. Hopefully forever? I\u2019d like to hear \u201cthis one\u2019s for Von\u201d amidst orange and blue confetti sometime in the next three years, thus completing the triumvirate of Denver Broncos legends I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be alive to witness make my father cry\u2014in action! In an immediate sign of good faith to me, specifically, George Paton and the Broncos exercised the sixth-year option on Von\u2019s $18MM salary, guaranteeing him at least $7MM this season. Should his health stay on the up-and-up, getting Von for just $18MM will look like a steal.\n\n**Boomerang Kareem**\n\nKareem Jackson has been one of the brightest spots on in an otherwise gloomy few seasons for the Broncos in recent years. Every good defense needs a hitter\u2014someone to [set the tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPd22C46wGo) for the rest of the team. In the No Fly Zone, that role was skillfully filled by both TJ Ward and Darian Stewart. In this iteration of the Broncos D, Kareem Jackson [wears that badge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oWaNnvoWfA) proudly. The Broncos declined the third-year option on his contract to kick off Free Agency, so Kareem decided to test the market. With nothing interesting (enough) biting, he returned on a team-friendly $5MM deal that keeps our hitter in Denver for one more year.\n\n**Locking Down Our Lock-Down**\n\nOnce again building some serious equity in my book, George Paton made the franchise-gratifying decision to offer Justin Simmons\u2014the league\u2019s near-best safety\u2014a four-year, $61MM contract, making him the league\u2019s highest-paid safety. While it initially looked as though Simmons would once again be forced to play on the Franchise Tag, Paton quickly inked a deal soon after the tag was agreed to. In five seasons, Simmons has totaled 369 (nice) tackles, 37 PBUs, 16 INTs, 2 sacks and a defensive touchdown. He\u2019s also one of the team\u2019s most active community members, an advocate for Black players in the league, and just an overall stand-up guy. We\u2019re lucky to have him.\n\n**Best Hands in the League**\n\nRounding out the excellent decision-making by this Front Office, enter: Shelby Harris. Though his teammates [don\u2019t think too highly of him as a man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbU2-xx1niY), they certainly think highly of him as a player. [As they should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsj2jI7VxTA). In 2019 alone, Harris notched *nine* pass breakups, along with 6 sacks, 49 tackles and a forced fumble. While 2020 was a bit wonky, stats-wise, Shelby has quickly become one of the predominate leaders on the team. The broncos inked him to a three-year, $27MM deal, anchoring one of the league\u2019s most effective interior lineman without handicapping the team. So long as the team can [put up with him](https://streamable.com/aszcy1), anyway.\n\n**Players Signed/Traded For**\n\n|POS|PLAYER|OLD TEAM|LENGTH|TOTAL|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**QB**|Teddy Bridgewater|Carolina Panthers|1 Year|$11.5MM|\n|**RB**|Mike Boone|Minnesota Vikings|2 Year|$3.85MM|\n|**WR**|Amara Darboh|N/A|1 Year|$0.85MM|\n|**WR**|De'Mornay Pierson-El|N/A|2 Year|$1.48MM|\n|**OT**|Bobby Massie|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$4MM|\n|**OT**|Cameron Fleming|New York Giants|1 Year|$1.67MM|\n|**OT**|Cody Conway|N/A|2 Year|$1.66MM|\n|**TE**|Eric Saubert|Jacksonville Jaguars|1 Year|$0.99MM|\n|**EDGE**|Pita Taumoepenu|Atlanta Falcons|1 Year|$0.85MM|\n|**DE**|Shamar Stephen|Minnesota Vikings|1 Year|$2MM|\n|**DT**|Isaiah Mack|Tennesse Titans|1 Year|$0.85MM|\n|**LB**|Peter Kalambayi|Houston Texans|1 Year|$0.92MM|\n|**CB**|Kyle Fuller|Chicago Bears|1 Year|$9.5MM|\n|**CB**|Ronald Darby|Washington Football Team|3 Year|$30MM|\n\n// NOTABLE NOT-SIGNINGS //\n\n**The QB Carousel Goes Round \u2018n Round**\n\nI really don\u2019t want to talk about this. If I have to watch even *one* more version of some junior ESPN animator\u2019s shitty rendition of a country fair ride featuring our failed quarterbacks, I swear to a-a-rod, I\u2019m switching to tennis. In half as many years, the Broncos have fielded 10 starting (or pseudo-starting) quarterbacks. 10. To salt the wound, we Broncos fans\u2014na\u00efve as we are\u2014thought we might come away with a shiny old Free Agent this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a Potential Sleeper Trade Partner for Matthew Stafford\u2026\u201d sure, Klis. \u201cDeshaun Watson wants to join Denver Broncos, ex-teammate says\u2026\u201d HA! \u201cAaron Rodgers to Denver\u2026as close to a done deal as it can be\u2026\u201d \\*sigh\\* somebody, please, just wake me up when we\u2019ve hit the Dalton line. The reality is, we\u2019ve got one more season of mediocrity at quarterback until boat rocking can commence. A new GM won\u2019t gamble away picks, players or surefire hall-of-fame cornerbacks (see: Draft Night writeup) in his first few months on the job. It\u2019s just not happening. And until it does, I\u2014for one\u2014plan on getting well acquainted with the floor.\n\n// NOTABLE SIGNINGS //\n\n**QB Teddy Bridgewater (2021 6th RD Pick &gt; Panthers // 1YR // $11.5MM // $10MMG)**\n\nWhelp, I\u2019m whelmed. The pre-draft trade rush for Teddy Bridgewater is at once a head-scratcher and a perfect fit for the post-Manning QB purgatory-era Broncos. For a daunting (sweet baby jeebus, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s only) backup quarterback\u2019s contract, the Broncos are on the hook for just up to $4.5MM this year. That\u2019s not terrible for 2020\u2019s 3rd-best completer of passes. Yes, Teddy threw 11 interceptions on the season (T-9th). And yes, he only threw for 15 touchdowns (24th). PFF isn\u2019t gospel\u2026but a 31st-overall ranked QB rating doesn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence after five consecutive losing seasons. Maybe Teddy can return to his former New Orlean glory. Maybe I\u2019ll finally work up the courage to ask Emma Watson out. Dreamers dream.\n\n**RB Mike Boone (2YR // $3.85MM // $2.6MMG)**\n\nI think Mike Boone will surprise more than a few people this year. A former UDFA, a Special Teams ace, and a decisive one-cut back, Boone has averaged 5.4 yards per carry across just 40 carries in his young career. He\u2019s also logged 523 Special Teams snaps and was well-regarded as one of the Vikings\u2019 most reliable four-phase ST players\u2014even earning an NFC Special Teams Player of the Week award. With high-level athleticism\u2014balance, speed, and burst\u2014and excellent vision, Mike Boone would have likely earned a spot as the Broncos\u2019 clear No.2 back. But, alas. He\u2019ll [certainly contribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOuSiiVsLiI) in some form.\n\n**OT Bobby Massie (1YR // $4MM // $1.575MMG)**\n\nGoing into his 10th year, Bobby Massie has been around the block. He even held Von to zero pressures against the Chicago Bears in 2019. At 6 feet and 325 pounds, Massie\u2019s size and athleticism have held up over the years. I\u2019m not going to pretend like I know enough to properly evaluate tackles, but I do know someone who does\u2014Mike Munchak, whose glowing review of Massie is enough for me. A wise man once said that the best ability is availability and, given the Broncos\u2019 recent woes at right tackle\u2026I\u2019m just glad we\u2019re no longer fielding traffic cones.\n\n**CB Kyle Fuller (1YR // $9.5MM // $9MMG)**\n\n\\[*Enter Full House Pun Here*\\]. Our CB room is overstuffed. And, sure, there probably won\u2019t be a year two of this relationship. But if you\u2019re going to burn a one-year rental on anyone, it might as well be an All-Pro CB who reached the height of his game under your current head coach. At the time of his signing, acquiring Kyle Fuller felt like (and arguable still is) a steal\u2014the Broncos suffered catastrophic losses to their CB room in 2020, resulting in a (don\u2019t you f\\*cking say it) carousel of 3rd-team and practice squad corners by December. Kyle Fuller is an *excellent* cornerback who is poised to lead the league in quarterback nightmares.\n\n**CB Ronald Darby (3YR // $30MM // $19.5MMG)**\n\nYou know, in the chaos of our run on cornerbacks this offseason, it feels like Ronald Darby got a little lost. Sure, he may have been made redundant by our first-round pick, but Darby was a [solid-to-great cornerback in Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIAhQsfL6E4), giving up just one touchdown and allowing only a 54.1 completion percentage last year. Admittedly, his contract isn\u2019t great. But with Kyler Fuller and Bryce Callahan likely to leave at the end of the season, Darby will likely play a lasting role in this secondary. Darby led the league in pass deflection is 2020 with 15. He won the CB2 job in Washington handily, despite coming in as a maybe-CB4 prospect. While he\u2019s struggled to stay on the field during his career, he\u2019s got a bright future in Denver under Vic and Ed.\n\n\\---\n\n# Draft\n\n|Pick|POS|PLAYER|SCHOOL|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1.09 (9)|**CB**|Patrick Surtain II|Alabama|\n|2.03 (35)|**RB**|Javonte Williams|North Carolina|\n|3.35 (98)|**C**|Quinn Meinerz|Wisconsin-Whitewater|\n|3.42 (107)|**LB**|Baron Browning|Ohio State|\n|5.08 (152)|**S**|Caden Sterns|Texas|\n|5.20 (164)|**S**|Jamar Johnson|Indiana|\n|6.35 (219)|**WR**|Seth Williams|Auburn|\n|7.09 (237)|**CB**|Kary Vincent Jr.|LSU|\n|7.11 (239)|**LB**|Jonathon Cooper|Ohio State|\n|7.26 (253)|**DE**|Marquiss Spencer|Mississippi State|\n\n**1.09 (9): CB Patrick Surtain II**\n\nIn the ninth pick of the 2021 NFL draft, the Denver Broncos select\u2026wait, what? I\u2019m sure that I speak for most Broncos fans when I say that, after Niners and Panthers passed on Justin Fields, I was salivating at the idea of drafting a potential top-3 prospect without giving up any picks or players. What fools we (hopefully) were. The Broncos elected to select the top player on their board, Patrick Surtain II\u2014a surefire Hall of Famer and literal Deion Sanders incarnate, who will go on to pick off Justin Fields at least once in 2022 before the Bears eventually trade him to the Dolphins for a 5th round pick and a bag of peanuts. Speaking of salty things, I\u2019m doing great, thanks. In truth, Surtain II was an excellent pick for us. Though we loaded up on high-performing corners in free agency, and drafted Iowa\u2019s Michael Ojemudia in the third last year, Surtain II\u2019s resume speaks for itself. His measurables? Off the charts. His football IQ? Honed since he was a wee lad. His accolades? Only getting started. The 2020 SEC Defensive Player of the Year has a bright future ahead of him, and the Denver Broncos are lucky to have him. Let\u2019s just hope we show him some love\u2014a half-decade of poor QB play does things to a fan\u2026\n\n***TRADE! Broncos give 2.08 (40), 4.09 (114), Falcons give 2.03 (35), 6.35 (219)***\n\n**2.03 (35): RB Javonte Williams**\n\nFor as confused as I was about our first-round pick, Javonte to Denver felt like destiny. I spent hours watching Javonte truck ACC defenders like a sentient bowling ball in the lead-up to the draft and mocked him us no less than eight times. In his 2020 season, and despite being part of a two-headed attack with Michael Carter, Javonte ran for over 1K yards and 19 touchdowns at 7.4 yards per carry. The kicker? 75\u2014yes, 75\u2014broken tackles, a rate of nearly half a broken tackle PER RUSH. That\u2019s a PFF record, by the by. But don\u2019t just take it from me\u2014here\u2019s what Javonte has to say about his running style: \u201cIf I see someone in front of me, I want to go through them\u2026\u201d [Remind you of anyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1XKjzq1_aM)? Javonte\u2019s linebacker upbringing is a sure contributor to his utter dad-dicking on the field, and I, for one, can't wait for this man to put the team on his back, doe. \n\n***TRADE! Broncos give 3.07 (71), Giants give 3.12 (76), 5.20 (164)***\n\n***TRADE! Broncos give 3.12 (76), Saints give 3.35 (98), 3.42 (105)***\n\n**3.35 (98): C Quinn Meinerz**\n\nIs there anything more loveable in this world than a delightfully large man-child who\u2019s unabashedly proud of his delightful largeness? Nicknamed \u201cthe belly,\u201d Meinerz is infamous for letting his pooch hang low\u2014though nowhere near the flo\u2014and his shirt sinch high. \u201cLet the belly breathe\u201d is the rallying cry/convenient excuse I can only assume I will use consistently throughout my future Dad years. Before the draft, George Paton hadn\u2019t even seen the [tree tackling video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV1OPvGanGQ)\u2014he and the staff got a kick out of it on the big screen just before they made the call. But enough about that. Meinerz is a highly athletic small school blocker who took the Senior Bowl by storm earlier this year. With any luck, he\u2019ll push a struggling Lloyd Cushenberry III and elevate our Center position to its former glory. We do have Munch, after all.\n\n**3.42 (105): LB Baron Browning**\n\nAnother player I mocked to the Broncos several times\u2014I was pleased to see that we haven\u2019t given up on the linebacker position entirely\u2026particularly with rumors of trading down in the first for JOK and Kollmann\u2019s whiskey-swilling baritone lulling me into a false sense of anticipation all offseason. Baron Browning is an exciting prospect for us\u2014he can play outside or inside, he\u2019s a hard-nosed tackler, and he has a clear Predator vision for the football. Unfortunately, Browning caught the injury bug early in OTAs, and will be off to a slow start with the team. Hopefully he\u2019ll fit right in when he returns, despite the lack of early reps.\n\n**5.08 (152): S Caden Sterns**\n\nI was a bit surprised to see that we drafted a safety here, though Caden Sterns is great coverage Safety prospect that should play a significant role in the Broncos\u2019 defense in the years to come. He plays with great control, vision and athleticism, but, at the same time, struggles against the run. For a guy that\u2019s built like a downhill safety, he\u2019ll need to clean up his tackling and first-jump instincts to be able to eventually take over as a starter on this defense. Learning from the likes of Justin Simmons and Kareem Jackson won\u2019t hurt.\n\n**5.20 (164): S Jamar Johnson**\n\nI was even more surprised to see us double dip at safety in the fifth round. Who needs an interior line when the Quarterback has literally no one to pass to, am I right? Guys? In any case, Jonson is another great prospect that has potential to turn starter in the coming years (they all do, don\u2019t they? The sunnies sure are rosy this time of year\u2026). Johnson also did secure Teddy Bridgewater\u2019s only interception of minicamp, so that\u2019s something. Johnson will likely see early playing time on Special Teams. Although, in the time that\u2019s passed since I initially wrote this, Jamar was put on the COVID exemption list. Not a good look, Jamar.\n\n**6.35 (219): WR Seth Williams**\n\nOur WR room is stacked at the moment, but another big body can\u2019t hurt. Seth Williams is 6\u20192 and 211lbs of pure Red Zone intrigue, racking up Auburn\u2019s fourth-most career receiving yards (2,124) in just three years. He\u2019s apparently intrigued at camp and could be an excellent stand-in for our other big-bodied receivers, should we need it. I like Seth Williams. Check out [this nasty little number](https://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/n2twt3/pff_broncos_6thround_pick_seth_williams_auburn/). I initially had him pegged for a roster spot, but he\u2019s had a pretty quiet camp so far.\n\n**7.09 (237): CB Kary Vincent Jr.**\n\nAgain with the Secondary, seriously? What is up with this offseason? Last year must\u2019ve been seriously scarring to Vic\u2019s defensive sensibilities. Kary Vincent Jr. is a slot corner out of LSU who was initially graded as a fourth-round prospect. He\u2019s been praised for his instinct, work ethic and football IQ, but time will tell as to whether that\u2019s enough to bump one of the Broncos\u2019 48 corners off of the roster. That said, if last year taught us anything, a strong bench of practice squad players is absolutely necessary.\n\n**7.11 (239): OLB Jonathon Cooper**\n\nHow can you not love a guy whose [neighborhood loves him](https://twitter.com/OhioStateFB/status/1389002304263753730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1389002304263753730%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.milehighreport.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22451348%2Fbroncos-roster-review-jonathon-cooper)? The Broncos made it clear that they prioritized high-character guys this draft, and Jonathon Cooper is the perfect example. Here\u2019s what George Paton had to say; \u201cI went to the Ohio State pro day. Watched the way he competed and the way he went about his workout and took it serious. How he worked out and the type of shape he was in. Then you speak with the kid. He\u2019s everything you want in a teammate and a player representing the organization.\u201d We\u2019ve seen a few [flashes](https://twitter.com/MaseDenver/status/1422613449775980550?s=20) from Cooper in camp, particularly during the first padded practice. He\u2019s also got a [big heart](https://twitter.com/TroyRenck/status/1422622731875627011). What\u2019s not to love?\n\n**7.26 (253): DE Marquiss Spencer**\n\nAt nearly 300 pounds, Marquiss Spencer could be a dominating force on the line. This behemoth of a human being recorded five sacks and 14.5 TFL in just 22 starts and has experience both as a 3-technique and 4-technique backer. Assuming he doesn\u2019t eat one of his coaches, I don\u2019t see why\u2014given our line depth\u2014Spencer wouldn\u2019t make the practice squad.\n\n**Notable UDFA: EDGE Andre Mintze**\n\nA two-time team captain and four-year speed rusher out of Vanderbilt, Mintze clocked one of the fastest 40-yd dash times at 4.59. The Broncos are known for shining up gemstones out of their UDFA recruits, and Dre Mintze might well be the next in line. Mintze has the smarts and the work ethic (a well-decorated master\u2019s earner), and while he does struggle against the run, his ceiling has yet to be uncovered. The Broncos gave him a sizable UDFA contract ($85,000 gtd)\u2014Mintze may make an immediate impact on special teams.\n\n\\---\n\n# Projected 53-Man Roster\n\n|POS|1|2|3|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**OFFENSE**||||\n|QB|Drew Lock|Teddy Bridgewater||\n|RB|Melvin Gordon|Javonte Williams|Mike Boone|\n|WR|Cortland Sutton|Tim Patrick|Trinity Benson|\n|LT|Garett Bolles|||\n|LG|Dalton Risner|Austin Schlottmann||\n|C|Lloyd Cushenberry III|Quinn Meinerz||\n|RG|Graham Glasgow|Netane Muti||\n|RT|Bobby Massie|Calvin Anderson||\n|TE|Noah Fant|Albert Ogkuebunam|Andrew Beck|\n|WR|Jerry Jeudy|KJ Hamler|Diontae Spencer|\n|||||\n|**DEFENSE**||||\n|EDGE|Von Miller|Malik Reed|Jonathon Cooper|\n|DE|Shelby Harris|Dre'Mont Jones|DeShawn Williams|\n|DT|Mike Purcell|McTelvin Agim|Shamar Stephen|\n|EDGE|Bradley Chubb|Derek Tuszka||\n|LB|Alexander Johnson|Justin Strnad||\n|LB|Josey Jewell|Baron Browning||\n|CB|Kyle Fuller|Ronald Darby||\n|SS|Kareem Jackson|Caden Sterns|Jamar Johnson|\n|FS|Justin Simmons|P.J.

Most members of the Broncos sub are tired of supercharged negative emotions driving the conversation about our most problematic room, so let\u2019s just look at the cold, dead facts. No Broncos quarterback has reached top-20 in the league since Peyton limped off into the sunset. Trevor Siemian\u2014the current 4th-man up in New Orleans\u2014boasts the strongest record and best rating among this group. At least we\u2019ve got no shortage of options\u2014like calling up our DB-WR PS convert (read: HERO) to the helm with less than 24 hours to prepare. Since you\u2019re all waiting for it, let\u2019s get this death march over with. Trevor Siemian. Brock Osweiler. Paxton Lynch. Mark Sanchez. Chad Kelly. Case Keenum. Kevin Hogan. Joe Flacco. Brandon Allen. Brett Rypien. Jeff Driskel. Drew Lock. And now, Teddy Bridgewater. By all accounts, Drew and Teddy are all tied up in this year\u2019s competition. There have been flashes. The offense looks leagues better than prior years. And yet, quarterbacks finished their latest practice with a pair of Red Zone picks after promising, full-field drives. It\u2019s poetic, really. Even without John, we Broncos fans are doomed to relive every \u2018promising offseason with flashes of brilliance\u2019 only to once again have our nuts kicked in by shitty Quarterback play. Is this what we *actually* gave up for Peyton? Is duck-slinging mediocrity meets picks-akimbo really our destiny? \\*sigh\\* If being a lifelong Broncos fan has taught me anything, it\u2019s this\u2014enjoy the good times while they\u2019re rolling. The road between is dark and full of terrors.\n\n**Backfield\u2014Strength**\n\nOkay, enough of the doom and gloom. There\u2019s a very good chance that we\u2019re going to be a rumblin\u2019, bumblin\u2019, shit-in-your-mouth-then-spit-in-your-eye football team this year, thanks, in large part, to our tailbacks. I\u2019ve already waxed poetic about Javonte\u2014who, by the way, looked like the dynamic Tonka truck we know him to be during his first padded practice\u2014but Melvin Gordon certainly deserves some praise. Early camp reports note [how much faster](https://twitter.com/CameronParkerPO/status/1422607026795040770) Melvin has looked this offseason, breaking off several impressive runs during the team\u2019s first padded practice. Melvin was far and away our strongest runner last year, finishing with nearly 1K rushing yards and 10 all-purpose touchdowns. This is shaping up to be an excellent one-two punch that I\u2019m very excited to see. Oh, and don\u2019t sleep on Mike Boone. As coach Fangio stated a few days ago\u2014he\u2019s [got the juice](https://gazette.com/sports/broncos-training-camp-observations-rookie-olb-jonathon-cooper-standing-out-on-and-off-the-field/article_9a839736-f487-11eb-967e-6f6005bee917.html) (too\u2026miss u phil.)\n\n**Pass Catchers\u2014Strength**\n\nWew lawdy, look out league. If we can somehow wrangle up a halfway-decent passing game, this receiving room is going to the moon. Jerry Jeudy is [consistently](https://twitter.com/DP_NFL/status/1422276748566278146) getting [RIDICULOUS](https://twitter.com/PFN365/status/1422645700588933121) separation at camp and may soon surpass Courtland Sutton for WR1 already. Court looks great in his recovery, pulling in balls like [THIS](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/1423004851395600390) while still not at 100% (by the way, yes, I know\u2026this QB situation is sus). Tim Patrick was a breakout star last year. KJ Hamler has the kind of speed roadrunners dream of. Even guys like Trinity Benson seem to finding the endzone in consistent fashion. We\u2019ve got arguably the most talented room of pass catchers we\u2019ve had since 2013/2014\u2014if not more talented. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned Noah Fant\u2014who looks massive and spent time with the league\u2019s great TE\u2019s at Camp Kittle\u2014and Albert O who flashed last year. [We\u2019ve got weapons](https://twitter.com/Broncos/status/1421222066099945474) for days, if we can, you know, pass the damn ball to them.\n\n**Offensive Line\u2014Neutral**\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how this year\u2019s offensive line will shape up. On one hand, we\u2019ve got one of the league\u2019s most impressive Left Tackles in All Pro Garett Bolles. Sloth allowed just half a sack in 2020, along with just 13 pressures. He was a rockstar. He\u2019s also a great dad. We love our big ugly (even those of us who were *very* ugly to him in his first few years). On the other hand, rookie Lloyd Cushenberry III had a\u2026tough year. His play even regressed once-standout LG Dalton Risner last year. And don\u2019t even get me started on the things we\u2019ve allowed at Right Tackle. It just makes me sad. This is an up-and-down unit with a ton of promise (see\u2014Lloyd Cushenberry III bulking up, playing well and handily sweeping the \u201ccompetition\u201d at C so far, along with Netane Muti biting at Graham Glasgow\u2019s heels for a chance to eat a man live, on-air), but not a lot to show for itself. Yet. With Mike Munchack at the helm, only time will tell.\n\n**Defensive Line\u2014Neutral/Strength**\n\nOn the other side of the trenches, we\u2019ve got a nice mixture of young and old. Shelby Harris and Mc\u2019Telvin Agim have had a great camp so far\u2014the former disrupting with at the LOS with those big paws of his, the latter doing the same (and even hauling one in for a pick-six). Dre\u2019Mont Jones is [expected](https://twitter.com/ZacStevensDNVR/status/1422341441926443010) to take a significant leap this year. Mike Purcell (though nipped by the injury bug early in camp) is one of our premiere run-stoppers. If we can stay healthy, this is a [strong defensive line](https://twitter.com/ZacStevensDNVR/status/1422978757812424717) that can cause chaos for Quarterbacks.\n\n**Linebackers\u2014Neutral/Strength**\n\nBit of a tale of two houses in our linebacker group. On the outside, we\u2019ve got a surefire Hall of Famer and his two young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. While Von and Bradley Chubb have only been on the field together for one full season, that season was like magic (to the tune of 26.5 sacks.) Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 #2 Malik Reed had a phenomenal 2020 season for an otherwise unknown entity, recording 8 sacks ad 52 tackles. Von speaks very highly of Malik, who may just be another Shaq Barrett-like star [in the making](https://twitter.com/ZacStevensDNVR/status/1422967331202895873). Von also [cheats when he fishes with Malik](https://twitter.com/georgestoia/status/1400504290515460096?s=21), which\u2014to be taught by a future Hall of Famer\u2014seems like an ok trade to me. On the inside, however, we\u2019ve historically struggled to maintain balance. While our ILB core of Alexander Johnson and Josey Jewell post great run-stopping grades, they\u2019re notoriously bad at coverage, particularly against big, strong, fast tight ends. Justin Strnad is supposedly getting beat in practice, and we\u2019ve yet to see any action from Baron Browning due to injury. So, for now, I\u2019m cautiously pessimistic.\n\n**Secondary\u2014Strength**\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing this team is lacking, defensive backs in not it. Last year\u2019s unit, comprised of whacky inflatable used car promotional men and the other guys Mark Wahlberg tried out next to during that movie that one time, somehow managed to keep it together\u2026ish. But you bet your sweet ass October through December 2020 haunt Vic Fangio\u2019s indigestion nightmares. Despite already having one of the league\u2019s top Slot Corners in Bryce Callahan, two of the league\u2019s top Safeties in Kareem Jackson and Justin Simmons and having drafted Michael Ojemudia in the 3rd not one year ago, we\u2019ve managed to add ELEVEN defensive backs in just a few short months. Now, I\u2019m not complaining\u2014the prospect of No Fly Zone 2.0 makes me feel all tingly in my special place\u2014but I think Vic and Paton might have a problem. In any case, and by all account, this secondary is going to be MEAN. I mean, just look at them. They\u2019re picking off balls [left and right](https://twitter.com/Jeff_Legwold/status/1422994766157991938). They\u2019re [undercutting routes](https://twitter.com/PFF/status/1422274762823376897). They\u2019ve got a guy named [Rojesterman](https://twitter.com/ZacStevensDNVR/status/1422974550501859334). What more can a fan want?\n\n**Special Teams\u2014Neutral/Weakness**\n\nThis unit is a bit of an enigma. Brandon \u201cThe Godfather\u201d McManus is an excellent kicker that we\u2019re lucky to have. Though I do love me some [God Peed](https://twitter.com/DSpencer4_/status/1338284290379980800), we haven\u2019t exactly figured out the return man situation. Reports from camp indicate that we may throw KJ Hamler a few\u2026but forgive me if getting our promising new receiver clobbered doesn\u2019t excite me. We signed an Australian punter and then cut him in favor of Sam Martin. That\u2019s cool, I guess. Overall, I don\u2019t know much about Special Teams, but I do know that the unit hasn\u2019t over-performed in years. Maybe this year that\u2019ll change!\n\n\\---\n\n# Unreasonably Optimistic Schedule Predictions in the Comments Below\n\nShoutout u/PlatypusofDeath for putting up with my hectic work schedule and making this happen each year.

There really is not a lot of edge talent outside of first round picks, and it's difficult to find outside corners after the 1st and 2nd rounds. With only 3 players from the first two rounds it was difficult to get that together, especially before I remembered Za'Darius Smith was a 4th rounder.\n\nFor 7th round picks, I feel like I used pretty much every position player that hit from that round and is still in the league.

I used [overthecap](https://overthecap.com/free-agency/) for signings which is good but not the best so I am sure I missed some.  I also used [football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) for stats, [Ourlads](https://www.ourlads.com/nfldepthcharts/) for player relevance and past depth charts, and [pro football history](https://pro-football-history.com/) for coaching changes.

Nagy returns for what looks to be a make or break year for him.  Lazor gets a second shot at OC, and a big one with Fields/Dalton as QB. DC Chuck Pagano retired and they promoted safeties coach Sean Desai to DC.  \n2. The rest of mentionables: They hired Michael Pitre to be their RB coach. Michael Was the RB coach/lead recruiter for the Oregon Ducks.  Chris Rumph comes in as D line coach after a nice college career and broke into the NFL coaching ranks last year with the Texans.  A few other minor promotions from within etc.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Mitch Trubisky - Mitch Titties is gone and the ~~Andy Dalton~~ Justin Fields era begins.  We\u2019ll see how quickly Fields starts for the Bears. In the meantime Dalton can keep them afloat.\n2. CB Kyle Fuller - Coming off of a bad season by his standards but he is a tough loss to this secondary as he takes a lot of responsibility on. Replacing him is Desmond Trufant and uhh I\u2019m not sure which is very\u2026. Very not good.\n3. LT Charles Leno Jr. - A consistent starter that helped steady this line for years.  He\u2019s not an elite LT but he is definitely a good one.  Rookie 2nd rounder Teven Jenkins has big shoes to fill.\n4. DB Buster Skrine - More of a fill-in/depth guy but in conjunction with Fuller\u2019s departure this looks worse.\n5. WR/KR/PR Cordarrelle Patterson - A much bigger loss than people will give credit as he\u2019s a top 5 special teamer in the league and field position matters big time.\n6. RT Bobbie Massie - Spent the ends of both of the last 2 seasons hurt but hone he was on the field he was pretty good, he\u2019s 32 now so I get letting him go but important depth being missed when Leno Jr. leaves is tough.\n7. OG Rashad Coward - More important depth that had starts last season that\u2019s departing.  He\u2019s young though.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Andy Dalton - Shroedinger\u2019s QB, simultaneously average, unreliable, steady, and can win games.  Came in to be the starter until Fields dropped low enough for the bears to go up and get him. He\u2019ll be on a short leash if he starts the season and both he and Fields give Robinson a big bump, and I see Mooney as a stash until Fields is in.  Indirectly they both help out Montgomery since he will have some amount of less focus with Dalton and more volume initially then less focus if Fields is good.\n2. Edge Jeremiah Attachou - Some nice athletic LB depth\n3. DL Angelo Blackson - Very nice DL depth addition, he fits the role of rotational at best and that\u2019s exactly what the depth chart needs.\n4. LB Christian Jones. -  Another depth addition that was a starter but shouldn\u2019t be\n5. RB Damien Williams - He\u2019s not touching David Montgomery or Cohen\u2019s snaps so he\u2019s purely depth.\n6. WR Marquis Goodwin - The guy had a breakout season in 2017 then got hurt in 2018 and 2019 then opted out for covid.  The speedster will be behind Mooney presumably in his role.\n7. TE Jesse James - He\u2019ll push Kmet for snaps.\"\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. QB Justin Fields (R1) - He joins a team that just signed Dalton for 3 seasons but who knows how that\u2019ll play out.  Surely this kid will start with the way the league works today.  If/When that happens let\u2019s look at what we can try to expect.  Fields\u2019 had a plethora of different plays he excelled at in Ryan Day\u2019s offense at OSU. My understanding is that they did A LOT of repetition of a lot of different types of plays that would work at the college level.  There wasn\u2019t a heavy emphasis on one or two things like Lawrence. So being familiar with a plethora of plays is good, being able to study/learn and execute many different types of plays is definitely important, the big question is how much will the jump to the NFL affect him specifically?  While I\u2019m a believer in Fields long term success, I don\u2019t know if I fully believe he\u2019ll make the transition smoothly. We\u2019ll see though.  It\u2019s also worth noting that Nagy and Lazor employed different offenses for Trubisky and Foles so again it\u2019s hard to assume what to expect the offense with Fields to look like.  Fields had a connection with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson in 2020.  Olave is a typical Z receiver and very good route runner with decent size. Wilson was more or less a slot receiver that played outside as well. He also has decent size.  In 2019 he worked well with Olave as his primary target, but also BInjimen Victor the big target and KJ Hill an underneath route runner.  At Georgia he spread it out more or less and also had a connection with the TE. \n2. OT Teven Jenkins (R2) - Will have a lot of responsibility as a rookie but is scouted as NFL ready.  He\u2019ll be a boost to Montgomery I believe.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT/NT Eddie Goldman - He started for the Bears in the 5 seasons prior (with 1 injured season cut short) and his return will ensure their depth at the position and give them run d versatility in their schemes. \n\n**Assessment** *Well it\u2019s tough to really know what to expect out of the offense considering Lazor and Nagy are probably trying to custom fit one for each QB and haven\u2019t exactly had real success offensively.  Frankly I can\u2019t be sure we can trust them to produce an a great offense.  Either way we have plenty to be excited about because ARob and Montgomery immediately get upticks regardless of which QB starts the season because both are better than what they had last year. Mooney who showed a lot of flash in his rookie season has real potential for a sophomore breakout as well, I really like him if Fields gets in but I don\u2019t expect it right out of the gate.  Jimmy Graham probably remains the same tier 3 TD dependent TE at this stage in his career.  The defense remains very good as well but the secondary isn\u2019t as good as last season without Fuller.*\n\n#Lions\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. They fired Patricia (with good reason) and hired Dan Campbell, a character in his own right with a big time emphasis on toughness.  He was a tight end as a player and his history is as a TE coach (Hockenson giving me a hard-on). From 2011-2015 he was the Dolphins TE coach.  He worked with Fasano, Clay, and Jordan Cameron. Fasano was past his peak but hit his career high 5 TD seasons both of the years working with Campbell.  He notably coached Charles Clay to his 759 yard 6 TD season., as well as Clay\u2019s other decent year. Jordan Cameron wasn\u2019t really a talent and was phased out of the offense.  In 2015 he served as the interim head coach of the Dolphins when they fired Philbin after week 4.  The team went 5-7 while featuring Jarvis Landry as the main cog in the offense. Lamar Miller had a down season compared to the rest of the peak of his career.  Tannehill had a career high in yards with a good TD/INT ratio.  Parker and Ajayi were rookies supporting the offense along with Kenny Stills who failed to meet expectations after his time with the Saints. Instead Rishard Matthews had a bit of a breakout.  From there he went to the Saints as TE coach/Asst head coach from 2016 through 2020.  Unfortunately in that time frame he wasn\u2019t given too much top end talent at the TE position in that time frame.  Coby Fleener finished his career with NO, Ben Watson returned to NO, Josh Hill well\u2026 we don\u2019t talk about that, then more recently Taysom Hill but he barely lined up as TE, and last year he worked with 33 year old Jared Cook.  So here we are with a man likely licking his lips at the opportunity to work with top end talent in their prime with Hockenson.  He seems like he\u2019ll be a good coach and he said along the lines of how some coaches don\u2019t like hiring people who could end up replacing them but he didn\u2019t care he wanted to surround himself with as much talent and knowledge as possible and he did.\n2. He brought in Anthony Lynn who was the HC of the the last few seasons. Lynn was not a good head coach for a few reasons but he did lead the chargers to a 12-4 season in 2018 and had shown the other reasons in which he was hired for.  Before his time with the Chargers he was tied to Rex Ryan with the Jets and Bills as the RB coach and assistant head coach, he also was a RB coach for the Browns and Cowboys even before that.  This is probably a factor as to why the Chargers running backs were so solid through his tenure there.  A simplified take on how he did throughout all of those jobs is that when he left the run game always took a dive at all of those places.  It\u2019s also noteworthy that he helped the RBs on his teams find some of their more successful seasons.  You have to figure he\u2019ll place a heavy emphasis on a balanced offense and therefore I expect Swift to have some really nice numbers this season with Jamaal Williams as nice support.  The Chargers offenses also supported a number 1 receiver every year with viable number 2 in most seasons between Tyrell and Mike Williams successes\u2026 however the offenses had real talent and Whisenhunt was likely the mind behind the offenses and last year Steichen.\n3. For DC the team hired Aaron Glenn who had served as the Saints secondary coach for the past 4 seasons and their DB coach the season before that.   I\u2019m not entirely sure I get this one as the Saints had one of the worst secondaries throughout most of that tenure.  The key positive takeaway is that the Saints invested draft capital and traded for players in the secondary and he coached them up from being very bad to better.\n4. Back to the offensive side of the ball, the team also brings in Duce Staley to be Asst Head coach/RB Coach.  Staley has been with the Eagles organization since his coaching career started and became the RB coach in 2013, getting a bump in job title adding Asst Head Coach in 2018.  That 2013 season was McCoy\u2019s monster of a year with another nice one in 2014. After that he was given very little talent to work with in Demarco Murray and Ryan Matthews at the end of their careers, Blount, Josh Adams, until rookie Miles Sanders was decent.   Of course Sproles was around in support as well as Clement and Scott\u2026 those 3 guys are why I\u2019m excited for him to work with Swift as a similar player (and very much not like him as a player hah)\n5. Mark Brunell comes in as the QB coach. It\u2019s his first shot as a coach at the NFL level.  He\u2019s been the head coach at Episcopal School of Jacksonville, a prep school, for the last 8 years.\n6. Antwaan Randel El also joins the staff as the WR coach. He served as an offensive assistant coach to Bruce Arians the last 2 seasons.  \n7. They bring over a new Special Teams Coordinator, a new DB/D Pass game coordinator, and a few others on the d side of the ball. They retain their TE coach with good reason.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Matt Stafford - It\u2019ll be weird to see Goff in at QB in Stafford\u2019s wake.  Stafford had a 4000 yard season despite Golladay being injured most fo the year. He spread it to Jones, Hockenson, Amendola, and a bunch of others to get there.  \n2. WR Kenny Golladay - Missed a ton of time injured last season but the guy is a stud when healthy.  His departure along with Marvin Jones will be a serious gap to fill for Tyrell Williams (hurt last season), Brashad Perriman, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.\n3. WR Marvin Jones - Jones was the number 1 producer in the pass game last season and showed he still has game.  On his own his departure hurts but with Golladay being traded this is a really tough loss.\n4. S Duran Harmon - Starting safety that was decent considering how bad the lions secondary was in general.  I\u2019m not sure who they intend on filling that hole with.\n5. LB Christian Jones - Starting outside linebacker that had his struggles last year but losing a starter without a defined replacement isn\u2019t fun\n6. DT Danny Shelton - They lost him but they brought in what very much should be an upgrade to his last season\u2019s performance Michael Brockers who at 31 is going to have to prove he can do it on a DL without Aaron Donald.\n7. RB Adrian Peterson - It\u2019s Swift\u2019s backfield now and that\u2019s a good thing!\n8. TE Jesse James (FA) - Typically not worth mentioning but he\u2019s in here because his replacement is Darren Fells whom I like a lot as an improvement in the pass game.  I expect some 2 TE sets with him and Hockenson considering their WR depth.\n9. MLB Jarrad Davis - Lost his starting spot but still contributed\n10. Danny Amendola (FA) - On its own isn\u2019t a bad loss but again this is a guy who contributed to the pass game and is now gone.\n11. K Matt Prater - Prater\u2019s best days might be behind him considering his fg% was around 75% last season so this loss isn\u2019t a bad one.  However Randy Bullock isn\u2019t much better and lacks Prater\u2019s range, even in a dome. \n12. OL/OG Joe Dahl - Important offensive line depth that started 13 games in 2019\n13. OL/OG Oday Aboushi - Important offensive line depth that started 8 games last season\n14. DB Justin Coleman - Important secondary depth but on a bad secondary so he\u2019s replaceable but who are they replacing him with?  His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill.\n15. DB Darryl Roberts - Important secondary depth that started 5 games last season.   His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill as well.\n16. RB Kerryon Johnson -  See: Adrian Peterson\n17. CB Desmond Trufant - The vet was injured most of last year and struggled when healthy.\n18. LB Reggie Ragland - Important depth at the LB psoition, on its own it\u2019s ok but another case where someone else\u2019s departure it hurts more. The other in this instance being Christian Jones.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Jared Goff - Only time will tell if this move was the right one for the Lions. While Stafford is better and Goff has a serious cap hit getting two firsts and a 3rd in the deal makes it seemingly more than worth it.  This especially considering Goff has had success in the NFL, the question is how much of the success was his and how much was the system.  Either way Goff is coming over to a team without a true number 1 receiver.  They have Tyrell Williams coming off of a season on the IR with a shoulder injury and never proved he could be a WR1.  Brashad Perriman who presumably maxes out as a WR2, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.  That is a big step down from Kupp/Woods/Reynolds and previously Cooks.  So you have to figure Hockenson is going to have to be a huge factor for this offense to move.  \n2. DT/DL Michael Brockers - The vet comes in and instantly is a nice addition to the d line. His success has been next to Aaron Donald though so take it with a grain of salt since his responsibility is to hold it down while Donald tears it up.  The team doesn\u2019t have anyone like Donald but they did invest a 2nd and a 3rd round pick to the DL.\n3. WR Tyrell Williams - He\u2019s getting another shot at being a number 1 receiver after a disappointing 2019 and sat out 2020 with an injury.  He\u2019s got the freshlegs but who even knows what to expect.\n4. Jamaal Williams - Joins an offense that will have to have a heavy emphasis on the run and he has proven he can be a 1B. In this instance he\u2019s not going to be a 1B but more a complimentary back since he and Swift are very different runners.  If the run game is good in general he\u2019ll be a top tier handcuff.\n5. WR Breshad Perriman - After a disappointing start to his career he\u2019s proven he can be an NFL receiver in some capacity but he probably maxes out as a WR2.  His addition is important to a team thin an WR talent. \n6. TE Darren Fells - I kind of love this pickup - it\u2019s a subtle addition that could mean a lot to the offensive playbook as he has decent hands and is an okay route runner.  I\u2019m bullish in saying that I see him as a TE handcuff that has some production of his own the way Boyle was for Fleener on the Andrew Luck Colts offense.\n7. LB Alex Anzalone - The angel haired inside LB joins a team that needs depth and fills in nicely hopefully. \n8. QB Tim Boyle - He replaces Chase Daniel as the backup QB. I\u2019m not sure why they paid him as much as they did as the backup but hey he\u2019s a backup QB.\n9. K Randy Bullock - Maybe an upgrade to Prater in accuracy, not by much though, definitely doesn\u2019t have the power of Prater\u2026 but he\u2019s an NFL kicker.\n10. CB Quinten Dunbar - Much needed CB depth, he\u2019s dealt with injuries recently\n11. S Dean Marlowe - Purely depth with no startability upside but they NEED it in the secondary.\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OG Penei Sewell (R1) - Tough to say you found a deal at the 4th overall pick but the Lions thought they got one at that spot and they just might have.  This guy is going to pave the way for what clearly will be an offense that relies on the run.\n2. DT Levi Nowuzurike (R2) A much needed addition to the D line.  Figure he\u2019ll compete to start out of the gate\n3. DT Alim McNeill (R3) - Some competition on this D line for snaps will probably be a good thing.  It\u2019s clear what the staff want to do in bulking up in the trenches (Eagles model)\n4. CB Ifeatu Melifonwu (R3) - Much needed addition to the secondary. He could compete for snaps out of the get go.\n5. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (R4) - I think he plays like a slightly shorter/weaker Keenan Allen as he\u2019s shifty but his quickness is more a product of his ability to see/find space mores than his feet.  He very well could have an immediate impact on this offense since there isn\u2019t probowl talent in front of him. Not to mention his amazing name makes for great fantasy team names. He\u2019s a dynasty target for sure.\n6. LB Derrick Barnes (R4) - Another guy who might just compete for snaps from day 1.  I figure he\u2019ll be rotational but could earn it in the tail. End of the season.\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Geronimo Allison - Wouldn\u2019t be mentioned if they still had Golladay but yeah I feel like he has a shot to make an impact considering the rest of the names in that WR room.\n\n**Assessment** *Here\u2019s what I can say with confidence.  BIG buy on Hockenson with the value of TE in fantasy, and definitely invest in Deandre Swift.  After that I\u2019m really not sure what to say here.  The team\u2019s defense was bottom tier in 2020 and lost a lot of players that they didn\u2019t replace.. a lot think it\u2019s addition by subtraction and I can buy that considering they did add to the line but we\u2019ll see.  All eyes on Goff but the offense can\u2019t be totally inept outside of Hockenson and the run game.  Jamaal Williams is a great handcuff to own.  Amon-Ra probably won\u2019t be viable until later in the season in redraft leagues.  Tyrell Williams and Brashad Perriman are bust/boom drafts more than boom/bust.  Goff is in for a challenge this season.*\n\n#Packers\n\n- **Personnel**  \n\n1. Lafleaur and Hackett remain HC and OC and there\u2019s no reason to think they shouldn\u2019t be.  Mike Pettine was not brought back as DC after he brought them from pretty bad to pretty decent.  They hired Joe Barry who was assistant head coach/linebackers coach of the Rams from 2017-2020. Before that he was the Redskins DC.  He also had a 2 year stint as the Lions DC that ended abruptly after their 0-16 season.  Anyways his last stint as DC with the Redskins he did well enough.  He brought them from the bottom of the league to the middle in terms of defensive statistics for the 2 seasons he was there.  His time with the Rams is tough to gauge as an assistant head coach/LB coach but obviously he did at least okay.\n2. The rest are essentially some job title improvements and responsibility distribution amongst the staff that was already in place.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Aaron Rodgers - DEFINITELY PRE-EMPTIVE but if the guy is going pretty much not going to be your starting QB he\u2019s essentially gone.  Things could change but we\u2019ll see. If Rodgers doesn\u2019t play for the Packers I expect the offense and the team to fall apart fairly quickly.  Davante is still going to produce no matter who\u2019s throwing the ball but after that I expect a serious hit to Aaron Jones when the pass threat isn\u2019t as deadly.  Even if the volume is greater the quality is likely too much of a drop-off unless Jordan Love turns out to be as good of a rookie as say Herbert was last season.\n2. C Corey Linsley - The stud center signed with the Chargers.  2019 2nd rounder Elgton Jenkins will compete with 2021 2nd rounder Josh Myers for the job.  By default they will be a downgrade at least this season.\n3. RT Ricky Wagner (FA) - The veteran was released despite starting 9 games fairly well last season.  He did split snaps throughout the year though.  Billy Turner is getting the endorsement to step up for the position next season. Which is fine.\n4. RB Jamaal Williams - He steadily helped the offense tick throughout all 4 seasons. He never achieved the goal of being a starter but he was top tier as a 1B.  I do believe AJ Dillon will be more than capable of filling his shoes. If Rodgers is their QB I actually have Dillon as having a potential to steal starting reps from Jones.\n5. ILB Christian Kirksey - Starting LB who doesn\u2019t have a clear cut replacement so his loss will be felt a little.. however he wasn\u2019t very good last season so next man up.\n6.  QB Tim Boyle - Actually not a good loss considering the current shenanigans\u2026 however Blake muthafuckin Bortles signed with the Packers so that\u2019s a nice step up for their 3rd QB who very well could be their 2nd.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Blake Bortles - That\u2019s it. He\u2019s literally the only free agent they signed from outside the organization.  It\u2019s a good signing and it\u2019s probably due to cap issues.  He\u2019s a good signing but they have holes to fill. \n- **Relavant Draft**\n1. CB Eric Stokes (R1) - He\u2019ll push Kevin King for a starting position opposite of Jaire Alexander.\n2. C Josh Myers (R2) - He\u2019ll compete with Elgton Jenkins to start.\n3. WR Amari Rodgers (R3) - Likely an instant starter and an automatic late round flier if Rodgers plays for the Packers this season.\n4. RT Royce Newman (R4) - Good depth at a position that needed depth\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Devin Funchess - I guess relevant but probably not\n**Assessment** *It all rides on Rodgers, plain and simple.  If he plays then buy high on Davante, at value for Aaron Jones, definitely take shots on AJ Dillon and Amari Rodgers. If Aaron doesn\u2019t play then well\u2026 just Davante at what his new value would be and Aaron Jones if he falls.*\n\n#Vikings\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. A bunch of promotion and shuffling from within happened. However there is one important note.  Gary Kubiak retired and his son Klint is now the Offensive Coordinator.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything worth taking away from that.  Maybe someone who\u2019s a diehard vikings fan and goes to training camp can weigh in on what to expect different from Gary. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. LT Riley Reiff - A veteran of the game and still is an NFL starter but his prime was a few years ago.  They drafted Christian Darrisaw in the first round to replace him.\n2. S/DB Anthony Harris - He wasn\u2019t a standout but definitely a piece to the puzzle for the secondary.  His replacement being Xavier Woods could be a step down but Xavier was probably the best piece of the Cowboys secondary and he\u2019s joining a team that has more pieces around him.\n3. LB Eric Wilson - Another starter lost on the defensive side but Wilson left fans wanting more considering Anthony Barr is the guy he was filling in for.  Barr returns from the IR this year to start again, but how much time does he have left?\n4. DE/Edge Ifeadi Odenigbo - He also got his first shot as a starter in the NFL and disappointed last season. They brought in Stephen Weatherly to help fill the hole but they also drafted guys in the 3rd/4th this year and DJ Wonnum in the 4th last year so it\u2019ll be a bit of a competition.\n5. DT Shamar Stephen - He started 15 and 16 games for the Vikings the last 2 seasons.  Like Harris he wasn\u2019t a standout but he was a piece to the puzzle.  However they have Michael Pierce returning from the Covid Opt Out list to step up.\n6. K Dan Bailey - He had one of the worst FG% in the league and so the team moved on from him.  South African Greg Joseph is competing with UDFA Riley Patterson for the position.\n7. DT Jaleel Johnson - Another starter lost. This one however is probably more of a case of addition by subtraction\u2026. Also the fact that they brought in Dalvin Tomlinson to fill the hole is a HUGE improvement\n8. QB Sean Mannion - Kellen Mond\u2019s arrival meant Mannion was out as the backup QB.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. DT Dalvin Tomlinson - A big time pickup for the front 7.  Him with Pierce will help stabilize the heart of the D to give it the opportunity return to their former success.\n2. CB Patrick Peterson - The veteran still has talent and his addition also helps the defensive side of the ball.\n3. DL Sheldon Richardson - Another very nice addition to the front 7 to help the Vikings recapture the image they once had.\n4. CB Bashaud Breeland - a decent pickup for their secondary.\n5. S Xavier Woods -  As with many in the Cowboys secondary he had his struggles but he did show ability and he joins a defense with more pieces around him so I expect a nice improvement to both the front 7 and the secondary next season.\n6. WR Dede Westbrook - I think he has a good chance to compete for the 3rd receiver spot behind Theilen and JJ.\n7. Edge Stephen Weatherly - He got his first opportunity to be the starter and wasn\u2019t exactly what the Panthers were looking for statistically and he finished the season on the IR. He\u2019s in competition with some young guns for the starting spot.\n8. LB Nick Vigil - Important depth behind Barr.\n9. CB Mackensie Alexander - Important depth\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OT Christian Darrisaw (R1) - A day 1 starter at LT will have some growing pains but he\u2019s very talented.  Reiff\u2019s replacement has big shoes to fill.\n2. OG Wyatt Davis (R3) - He won\u2019t have to start out of the gate but could earn snaps\n3. QB Kellen Mond (R3) - I like him as a backup with potential in the future\n4. DE Patrick Jones II (R3) - Will compete to start this season\n5. MLB Chazz Surrat (R3) - Important depth behind Kendricks\n6. DE Janarius Robinson (R4) - Will compete to start the season\n7. S Camryn Bynum (R4) - Important depth behind Xavier Woods\n8. RB Kene Nwangwu (R4) - I think this was a draft based on measurables. He\u2019ll have 2 seasons to develop behind Cook and Mattison when Mattison will become a FA.\n9. TE Zach Davidson (R5) - He could end up being a receiving threat down the line but he isn\u2019t built to be an NFL TE yet. He has height but not functional strength/size. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT Michael Pierce - It was tough for the team not to have him available last season after bringing him in to steady the line but this year having him around along with Tomlinson will be huge, literally.\n\n**Assessment** *The team obviously focused on their defense in a big way but also their O line.  The main thing to focus on is Klint Kubiak and what that means for the offense. He\u2019ll need to command the same respect as his father.  Regardless it\u2019ll be safe to assume nice season from Cook, Theilen, and Jefferson. They don\u2019t really have a TE for the sake of moving the ball so it\u2019s those 3 alone that will be the workhorses as they have been.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes NFC North", "created": 1628554151.0, "players": ["Aaron Rodgers", "Adrian Peterson", "Chase Daniel", "Danny Amendola", "Jared Cook", "Matt Prater", "Jimmy Graham", "Patrick Peterson", "Andy Dalton", "Buster Skrine", "Dan Bailey", "Lamar Miller", "Michael Brockers", "Randy Bullock", "Kenny Stills", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Keenan Allen", "Sheldon Richardson", "Desmond Trufant", "Blake Bortles", "Jarvis Landry", "Anthony Barr", "Christian Jones", "Aaron Donald", "Kyle Fuller", "Christian Kirksey", "Bashaud Breeland", "Shamar Stephen", "Damien Williams", "Josh Hill", "Darren Fells", "Danny Shelton", "Eddie Goldman", "Devin Funchess", "Sean Mannion", "Jesse James", "Breshad Perriman", "Darryl Roberts", "Angelo Blackson", "Dean Marlowe", "Tyrell Williams", "Justin Coleman", "Anthony Harris", "Jared Goff", "Mackensie Alexander", "Reggie Ragland", "Nick Vigil", "Geronimo Allison", "Stephen Weatherly", "Michael Pierce", "Mike Williams", "Jamaal Williams", "Dede Westbrook", "Jarrad Davis", "Kevin King", "Kenny Golladay", "Xavier Woods", "Dalvin Tomlinson", "Aaron Jones", "Ifeadi Odenigbo", "Jaleel Johnson", "Eric Wilson", "Alex Anzalone", "Taysom Hill", "Kerryon Johnson", "Josh Adams", "Christian Kirk", "Jaire Alexander", "Greg Joseph", "Tim Boyle", "David Montgomery", "Miles Sanders", "Jordan Love", "AJ Dillon", "Kellen Mond", "Janarius Robinson", "Binjimen Victor", "Justin Fields", "Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Chris Olave", "Amari Rodgers", "Dan Campbell", "Marvin Jones", "Duce Staley", "Aaron Glenn", "Mike Williams", "Patrick Jones II", "Eric Stokes", "Camryn Bynum", "Alim McNeill", "Ifeatu Melifonwu", "Garrett Wilson", "Derrick Barnes", "Kene Nwangwu", "Patrick Jones II", "Riley Patterson", "Zach Davidson"]}, {"author": "JPnightmare", "created_utc": 1628632982, "id": "p1zexd", "score": 1, "selftext": "**Quarterback (QB)**\n\n**Tier 1**\n\n1.

However based on the past few seasons, I think there are a few counter arguments thar can be made.\n\n**Counterarguments**\n\n* In the past three seasons, Matt Ryan has finished in the top 5 for pass completions and attempts and as averaged ~4600 in that span (~4500 since 2015). Understood that the landscape has favored an elite QB to have that rushing factor but take that away and your next set of QBs should have to throw a lot to stay relevant and we can\u2019t deny Matt Ryan loves to sling the rock.\n\n* Has an elite receiving threat in Ridley and other underrated offensive weapons in Gage and Hurst and potentially Kyle Pitts\n\n* Offense will be playing from behind quite a bit given their defense so there\u2019s going to be lots of passing (can group this in bullet one but wanted to separate this). I know this is seen as a crutch argument by those of you that follow Chris Harris but there\u2019s definitely some truth to this\n\n* From football analysis  and podcasts that I have read and listen respectively, Arthur Smith is seen as an offensive guru of sorts. I know he seemed to employ a run heavy scheme but with someone like Derrick Henry on your roster it made sense. None of us can say how good Smith will be as a coach but alternatively we can\u2019t be quick to assume how he will utilize this offense - he could very well play to the strength of the pass heavy offense utilized in prior years for the Falcons \n\n**Arguments**\n\n* New coach and OC. I put the  Arthur Smith hire as a counter argument but you can easily make the case for arguing for the drop in Ryan\u2019s ADP due to the offense he has employed in Tennessee as the Offensive Coordinator there. Additionally, enter Dave Ragone, the new OC, who previously served as the pass game coordinator for the Chicago Bears - I know noothing about this guy so I can\u2019t really say much in regards to that hire and the offensive philosophy that he implemented in Chicago.\n\n* Lose one of the greatest receiving talents in Julio. I can\u2019t say how many yards in a season was attributed to Julio receptions and YAC but I would imagine it was quite a bit given his insane receiving totals. This leaves quite a few yards and receptions vacated for Ridley and some of the supporting cast who don\u2019t have the same playmaking/physical ability as Julio\n\n* Age. Matty Ice just turned 36 and while he seems like he has a few solid seasons left, you never know how this may affect him this season. \n\nGiven all this, I certainly am not saying Matt Ryan can finish as the QB1 let alone in the top five but I feel like he can be a top 7 -8 QB this season just given his penchant for passing and the nature of the team and you can get him in the double digit rounds. I think he should be going near guys like Stafford in terms of ADP. You can definitely build up some serious depth in your roster this year and snag Ryan in the late rounds.\n\nWhat are your guys\u2019 thoughts on Matt Ryan this year? Do you guys see a decline this year? Is he appropriately ranked? Do we see some value in regards to his ADP? Would love to hear your thoughts!", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Is Matt Ryan being undervalued among QBs drafted this season?", "created": 1629275026.0, "players": ["Matt Ryan", "Derrick Henry", "Kyle Pitts", "Dave Ragone"]}, {"author": "slivr33", "created_utc": 1628532829, "id": "p1724h", "score": 1, "selftext": "I was mostly doing it for myself in draft prep but figured I could dress it up a bit and send it to you guys.  I used [overthecap](https://overthecap.com/free-agency/) for signings which is good but not the best so I am sure I missed some.  I also used [football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) for stats, [Ourlads](https://www.ourlads.com/nfldepthcharts/) for player relevance and past depth charts, and [pro football history](https://pro-football-history.com/) for coaching changes.

Arthur Smith comes on as the head coach after it was clear that Raheem Morris wasn\u2019t the right coach for the job in the first year.  Arthur had some serious success as the Titans OC seeing as he made very productive players out of Tannehill and Corey Davis who had previously only shown talent but not an ability to put it to consistent use.  Obviously under his offense the Derrick Henry had 2 consecutive monster seasons as well.  Before he was their OC he was their TE coach getting the most out of Jonnu Smith and Delanie Walker.  There is a lot to like about the potential this guy brings.\n2. For OC they brought in Dave Ragone who worked with Smith on the Titans in 2011/2012/2013.  Smith was a defensive assistant/quality control coach then offensive assistant/quality control, then o-line/asst TE coach and Ragone was the WR coach then QB coach so they must have worked closely especially in that 3rd season.  From there Ragone took a season off before coming back to the NFL as an offensive quality control coach with the Redskins, followed by becoming the QB coach for the Bears from 2016-2019 and got upgraded to the passing game coordinator in 2020.  Because Matt Ryan is a completely different QB from Trubisky and widely more talented I won\u2019t try to compare and predict how the offense will run.  This especially considering Smith was a TE coach and they drafted Kyle Pitts.  As pass game coordinator they fed ARob, but that was an obvious move considering he\u2019s the most talented guy on the offense.\n3. Dean Pees also comes over from the Titans, making a lateral move as DC.  This is a great hire considering he\u2019s had success with the Patriots, Ravens, and Titans as DC before this.  However this is probably the least talented roster he\u2019ll have worked with to date so it will be a challenge.  At the very least I see some improvement coming from this hire alone.\n4. The QB coach they hired, Charles London was a RB coach tied to Ragone from his time with the Bears\u2026 again with Ragone as well as Smith in 2011 with the Titans.  I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d hire a former running back, who became a RB coach to be your QB coach but here we are.\n5. They bring in Justin Peelle fas TE coach which is important considering Pitts is going to be the 2nd receiving option on the team.  Peelle had great success as the Eagles TE coach over the years.\n6. They keep their WR coach, they hired a new OL coach who has had success at the college level and is getting his first NFL shot.  Another guy getting his first shot is their new RB coach Des Kitchings who has ascended college coaching ranks in a few different ways and is ready to make the jump.  They hired former Giants DL coach Gary Emanuel which is a solid hire considering their line has been decent. Frank Bush comes in as the LB coach and he\u2019s a great football mind to bring on.  As well as another potentially good hire at secondary coach with Jon Hoke who\u2019d been with the Bucs and the Bears before that.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. WR Julio Jones - Holy shit what a major loss to the team. It was probably the right move at the right time because of it\u2019s unavoidability but you know it still hurts. Ridley has proven he can be the guy with or without Julio and that will remain true but now the number 2 weapon is rookie TE Kyle Pitts. Let the hype train commence.  Russel Gage is going to have to step up in a way we haven\u2019t seen him do without 2 other receiving threats on the field at the same time for.\n2. RB Todd Gurley (FA) - The man\u2019s legs just aren\u2019t what they used to be and it\u2019s a damn shame.  He was still productive in the red zone but just couldn\u2019t break runs the same way.  Mike Davis is coming off of a career season backing up McCaffrey to replace Gurley here but I\u2019m not entirely certain he\u2019ll be much better especially behind that offensive line.\n3. LG James Carpenter (FA) - While he wasn\u2019t a great or even very good LG he was their starter and a veteran of the league.  At this point the only even potentially startable LG on the roster is rookie 3rd round pick Jalen Mayfield who also projected as a tackle.  \n4. S Keanu Neal - Essentially the sole bright spot of a secondary that had a lot of struggles throughout the entire season seemingly.  They also lost his counterpart at safety Ricardo Allen.  2020 4th rounder Jaylinn Hawkins will compete with Duron Harmon to the gap for Keanu.   Also Rookie second rounder Richie Grant will be in the mix.\n5. S Ricardo Allen - He struggled early in the season but got better as the year progressed and to lose him with Neal is not ideal.  To replace him they signed Erik Harris.  Also rookie second rounder Richie Grant will be in the mix.\n6. OL Justin McCray - Rotational depth that is an important loss when Carpenter could end up elsewhere.\n7. DL Allen Bailey (FA) - Rotational player on the defensive line. His loss feels more like addition by subtraction at this stage in the vet\u2019s career.\n8. QB Matt Schaub - Replaced by AJ McCarron as the backup QB.\n9. RB Ito Smith - Probably the weirdest hype train, but yeah he didn\u2019t live up to the bit of hype he carried and now he\u2019s a FA.\n10. S Damontae Kazee - Another loss to the secondary that wasn\u2019t good. He was hurt for most of the year.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. RB Mike Davis - At this point is the sole starting RB.  Qadree Ollison, 2019 5th rounder looks like his only current competition\n2. WR/RB Cordarrelle Patterson - A fantastic special teams addition and seemingly has some gadget viability.\n3. S Erik Harris - Looks like it could be a lateral move to Ricardo Allen but it\u2019s tough to know but neither were good last season is my understanding. \n4. DB Duron Harmon - Harmon has aged like a fine wine in the NFL apparently.  The true journeyman was given his first real opportunity to earn consistent snaps for the Pats in 2018, his 6th season with them.  He filled in as a starter to end the year in 2019. Then last year he was given his first opportunity to completely start with Detroit and played all 16 games.  He was above average on a very bad secondary\u2026 he\u2019ll have to be the same here if he starts.\n5. Edge Barkevious Mingo - He\u2019s rotational depth at this point in his career but ATL is thin at the position so it\u2019s a good pickup\n6. CB Fabian Moreau - Important corner depth that the team lacks\n7. LB Brandon Copeland - Important LB depth\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. TE Kyle Pitts (R1) - Looks like he\u2019s going to be the offense\u2019s number 2 weapon right out of the gate quite possibly.   Can\u2019t wait to watch fantasy owners reach way too high for him but then it still works out since he\u2019s an animal.\n2. S Richie Grant (R2) - He\u2019ll compete to earn snaps and could make a nice impact on the team\u2019s struggling secondary.\n3. OL Jalen Mayfield (R3) - Very possibly could end up starting at LG this year.\n4. C Drew Dalman (R4) - Important center depth\n5. CB Darren Hall (R4) - Important CB depth on a secondary that is putting itself together\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *I love the personnel hires, they potentially might have righted a ship that has been letting on water for the last few staffs. That being said with the players there just look to be more and more holes popping up for the players.  I think the defense remains bad for another season and the offense is incomplete and also isn\u2019t great.  That being said Ridley is still a stud and Pitts very well should be as well.  Mike Davis should be a viable RB2 on volume and Qadree Ollison is one of those true boom or bust grabs because of the potential for him to be the starter that few saw coming.  I\u2019m not a believer in Gage but I know many are.  I just don\u2019t think the o-line will be able to sustain more than Ridley on a consistent basis and I believe in Pitts over him.*\n\n#Panthers\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. Minor changes only.  The biggest change was hiring Sean Ryan to be their QB coach. Ryan was the QB coach for the Lions the last 2 seasons, the QB coach for the Texans the 2 before that, and a mix of QB or WR coach for the Giants before that. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Teddy Bridgewater - He may not have been the QB of the future for the team but he was solid despite the offense losing its\u2019 best player in CMC.  He sustained 2 1000+ yard receivers and Curtis Samuel had 851 yards on top of that.  Sam Darnold is given offensive talent for the first time in his career so we\u2019ll see how it goes as a replacement.\n2. WR Curtis Samuel - The team\u2019s WR3 but his role was so unique he won\u2019t be replaced.  He had 2 rushing TDs and over 1000 all purpose yards.  The team figured out how to use him more and more as the season went on.  To replace his production they brought in Seahawks receiver David Moore and drafted Terrence Marshall in the 2nd round.\n3. RB Mike Davis - He was handed the reigns for the first time in his career. That was done out of necessity but he stepped up in a big way for the most part.  His season tailed off but there isn\u2019t a replacement on the team so it\u2019s all McCaffrey and nobody behind him. \n4. S Tre Boston (FA) - The team\u2019s starting FS for the past 2 seasons wasn\u2019t as good as earlier in his career and they drafted Jeremy Chinn in the 2nd last season so they probably believe in him to step up this year. \n5. OT Russel Okung (FA) - Spent the last 2 seasons on and off the field for stints. The vet can\u2019t stay healthy.  Greg Little who spent the year on the IR takes his place.  They also brought in Cameron Erving and drafted Brady Christiansen in the 3rd round.\n6. DL Kawaan Short (FA) - Spent the last 2 seasons on and off the field for stints. The vet can\u2019t stay healthy.  2020 first round pick Derrick Brown filled in for his interior usage last year and a few guys rotated in for his DE usage, this year Gross-Matos the 2020 2nd rounder should handle those duties for the most part.\n7. MLB Tahir Whitehead (FA) - He outright stunk last season. He started the year as the starter and finished the year on and off of the field with injury but lost his starting spot. Denzel Perryman is going to be the one filling the hole.\n8. Edge Stephen Weatherly - After getting his first opportunity to start in his 5th season on a 1 year deal with the Panthers he leaves to return to Minnesota.  He was okay before he got hurt and finished the year on the IR.  Efe Obada and Gross-Matos filled in for him. \n9. DT/NT Zach Kerr - He was more or less package based and rotational but he was a serious run stopper. They\u2019re choosing youth to fill the role.\n10. LG Chris Reed - The veteran got his first go at starting and did decently.  There will be a competition to fill the hole but they may have to protect whoever comes into that spot.\n\n11. Edge Efe Obada -Rotational depth.\n\n12. FB Alex Armah - They brought in a UDFA Mason Stokke to fill the role.  Stokke was a LB and switched to FB in 2018 so he\u2019s not as experienced but he has the physical prowess.  We\u2019ll see if he makes the 53.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Sam Darnold - I was a big believer in Darnold when he was drafted out of college but I think at this point he\u2019s shown he isn\u2019t going to be the QB of the future.  As a stop-gap QB let\u2019s try to anticipate what we can expect out of Darnold.  We did see a small boost for Tannehill post-Gase and a very significant bump when he left Miami.  I just worry that we haven\u2019t seen enough attributes or traits out of Darnold in comparison to Tannehill that we knew had tools but never put it together.  Either way he has a 1/2 punch that he was never even close to with the Jets in CMC with DJ Moore and Robby Anderson.  Speaking of Robby Anderson he\u2019s reunited with Darnold so you have an instant connection there but talent always wins out so look to DJ Moore to continue his trend of taking over as the season progresses.  I won\u2019t delve into fit because it\u2019s always night and day from with Gase to without him.\n2. Edge/LB Haason Reddick - Came into his own in his 4th season, the versatile player joins some flash and youth. I think this is a very nice addition if he fits in.\n3. OT/OG Cameron Erving - He struggled with injury last year but the now journeyman will have an opportunity to earn more snaps on the Panthers line who has talent but also holes to fill.\n4. WR David Moore - He\u2019s replacing Curtis Samuel as the WR3 and will have competition with rookie Terrance Marshall Jr. but his experience should be valuable to the offense as a safety net.  He likely won\u2019t be viable as a fantasy player though.\n5. OG/C Pat Elflein - He got hurt early in the season but played every snap of the games he played to finish the year out with the Jets.  That familiarity with Darnold could be helpful but he really wasn\u2019t good but none of the line was\u2026 He\u2019ll compete for snaps/to start.\n6. DL DaQuan Jones - A super nice pickup to the front 7. If they find the right way to use him he\u2019s instantly going to make an impact in the trenches.\n7. CB AJ Bouye - He wasn\u2019t as good in Denver as they\u2019d hoped, getting hurt doesn\u2019t help that but now he won\u2019t have as many responsibilities even if he earns the starting spot and that\u2019s where he really shines.\n8. DL Morgan Fox - Important depth. He could prove to be better than expected just because he was overshadowed by the Rams study d line\u2026 or he could just not be good enough, which is why they brought others in.\n9. TE Dan Arnold - I speak for DHop owners everywhere that this dude was a low-key vulture last season in the worst way because you never saw it coming.  He\u2019s just a good TE and will force Ian Thomas to prove himself.\n10. LB Denzel Perryman - Not a very great pickup but they had to get an inside linebacker one way or another.\n11. CB Rashaan Melvin - He opted out of the 2020 season and joins his former teammate AJ Bouye and will have to earn snaps in what really looks like a deep cornerback unit.\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. CB Jaycee Horn (R1) - Joins a secondary that has potential next season. He\u2019ll have to earn snaps to prove himself but is in a good situation once he does.\n2. WR Terrence Marshall Jr. (R2) - I don\u2019t think he\u2019s super NFL ready but I could be wrong.  He\u2019s a big receiver with good hands but needs to work on his route running. He could have some surprise deep balls in mid season once he learns the offense but before teams figure him out.\n3. OL Brady Christiansen (R3) - Very important depth and lots of opportunity for snaps on the team so he could earn some.\n4. TE Tommy Tremble (R3) - Will be buried behind Ian Thomas and Dan Arnold this season at least.\n5. RB Chuba Hubbard (R4) - He comes in as a change of pace back. He is more of a home run RB and not as many tools in his shed as CMC (but that\u2019s true for most).  He could earn some touches to prevent CMC from having too much wear and tear but I\u2019m not sure about him overall.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team**\n\n**Assessment** *The personnel are in year 2 and I think ownership is cautiously optimistic on their hires. The team lost a key piece in Curtis Samuel but filled A LOT of holes elsewhere. They focused on the DL, the OL, and the secondary and I think they did a decent job. What matters the most is that it all rests on Darnold shoulders. What is his ceiling? How long will it take him to find it?  I obviously will trust CMC this season and assume he\u2019ll stay healthy.  I also believe in DJ Moore to be a viable player. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be reaching to draft him at all.  Robby Anderson you have to figure will put up consistent numbers and be a safe flex or WR2 play.  The TE position is a tough one to assume a lot of strength but it\u2019s tough to assume with a new QB.*\n\n#Saints\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1.  They lost their QB coach and their defensive back coach to other teams but it primarily stayed the same overall with some shuffling of titles and support positions.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Drew Brees (Retired) - The legend moves on to greener pastures and now it\u2019s up to Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill to fill the void. An impossible challenge for either but we\u2019ve seen some successes with both in some capacity.  The general belief is that it has to be Jameis for the most part but it\u2019s tough to know for sure with Sean Payton.\n2. Edge Trey Hendrickson - He got his first endorsement as a starter and he stepped up in a big way to break out. Marcus Davenport started there the year prior and will be back there this season presumably.  They also drafted Peyton Turner in the 1st round (In anticipation of Cam Jordan aging out soon).\n3. WR Emmanuel Sanders - He probably expected to play with Brees for the most part but he also expected to be the team\u2019s WR2.  With both Brees and Thomas both missing significant time last season (Kamara missing some time too). He was good but not great and that\u2019s fair. There really isn\u2019t a replacement to fill the WR2 void so again it all falls on Thomas and Kamara to lead the way\u2026. With nobody behind them at all.\n4. CB Janoris Jenkins - The veteran CB still played well last season and moved on to the Titans. They drafted Adebo Paulson in the 3rd round and have Patrick Robinson to fill the gap which is definitely going to be a step down.\n5. DL Malcom Brown - This is an actually pretty tough loss to the front 7.  He was good for the patriots for 4 seasons then was good for the saints the last 2 seasons. He doesn\u2019t really have a replacement but you can figure they\u2019ll change up the scheme to match the players.\n6. OL Nick Easton - He was drafted as a center but started as a guard in 15 of the 22 games played for the saints in the last 2 seasons. Cesar Ruiz, 2020 first round pick will fill in nicely presumably.\n7. TE Jared Cook - Normally losing a 34 year old TE wouldn\u2019t be a significant loss but without Sanders the offense is very obviously locked in with MT and Kamara as their 2 main weapons and Taysom Hill as a gadget.  He\u2019s replaced by Nick Vannett\n8. LB Kwon Alexander - The Saints traded for him mid-season and he was below average but okay for them on a rotational basis. \n9. P Thomas Morstead - While he didn\u2019t have the greatest leg, he knew the special teams system well.  He was towards the bottom in punt yards but was top 10 in net yards.  The signed former UDFA Blake Gillikin who was pretty good for Penn State but there were a decent number of punters with a better avg.\n10. TE Josh Hill - We know he isn\u2019t going to be a receiving threat but this is a case of without Cook this loss is more relevant.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. TE Nick Vannett - I suppose he\u2019ll be their receiving TE but my expectations aren\u2019t exactly high.\n2. Edge Tanoh Kpassagnon - He\u2019ll be a nice rotational player on the d line which needed a depth piece.\n3. FB Alex Armah - This is actually really nice for Kamara\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. DE Payton Turner (R1) - A good pickup for the future of their pass rush and doesn\u2019t have to start out of the gate but can compete for snaps.\n2. LB Pete Werner (R2) - A versatile LB with coverage abilities will come in and potentially be their starting Sam and very well could be.  It\u2019s a hole that needs to be filled.\n3. CB Adebo Paulson (R3) - A pick for the future that could also compete for snaps right away.\n4. QB Ian Book (R4) - A shot in the dark for a more conventional backup QB\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *I do like Winston and am a bit of a believer in him.  I think he has the talent to succeed with the coaching that is in place in NO. HOWEVER, he only has 2 weapons on the offense and a weird thing going on where Taysom Hill very well could be the starter.  Essentially the offense did well enough to sustain Kamara without Brees last year so you can assume he\u2019s a safe bet if he\u2019s healthy. Then Michael Thomas is a stud so you can assume he\u2019ll help carry whomever is the QB.  After that it would be a surprise if any of the depth guys emerge as viable fantasy targets.  TreQuan Smith should be the number 2 but I don\u2019t figure he\u2019ll be able to sustain much.  The FB signing is a big indicator of what the teams ants to do.  On the defensive side of the ball I expect a decent drop-off from the progress made in the last 2 seasons.  They did invest in the draft for the future but I don\u2019t see this year being the year that those investments pay off.* \n\n#Buccaneers\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. No significant changes at all.  The SB champs tried to keep everyone and they did for the most part.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. OL Joe Haeg - A rotational depth lineman. When this is your worst loss to your SB winning team that\u2019s a very good thing.\n2. OL AQ Shipley - Another rotational depth lineman\u2026 that\u2019s it that\u2019s everyone of even relative significance.  LeSean McCoy had 132 scrimmage yards in 10 games would be the next most relevant drop.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. Gio Bernard - Comes in to fill the void left by McCoy which isn\u2019t a significant one.  I think he fills a need in a very good way as a pass catching back. Fournette was their 3rd down back last season and had enough drops that this move is actually really nice.  It\u2019s the only one of significance that they made and it makes sense.\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. OLB/Edge Joe Tryon (R1) - A great addition to rotate in behind JPP and earn some snaps.\n2. QB Kyle Track (R2) - Could be the QB of the future, could be a bust but Brady was cool with it so nothing to worry about.\n3. OL Robert Hainsey (R3) - Nice OL depth\n4. WR Jaelon Darden (R4) - He won\u2019t see the field any time soon outside of maybe special teams since he\u2019s behind Evans/Godwin/AB/Scotty Miller but he\u2019s more of a gadget speedster so his skillset is different from them. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *See: 2020 Buccaneers.  Apparently Brady didn\u2019t even have the playbook down until closer to week 10 so.  That\u2019s when Mike Evans turned it up in a big way despite playing through some injuries (as he usually does).  It\u2019s also when AB joined the team.  I\u2019ll be curious to see how everything plays out in terms of touches between the 3 receivers and Gronk after a full offseason with the playbook.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes AFC South", "created": 1628554429.0, "players": ["Drew Brees", "Jared Cook", "LeSean McCoy", "Matt Ryan", "Matt Schaub", "Emmanuel Sanders", "Julio Jones", "Allen Bailey", "Patrick Robinson", "Janoris Jenkins", "Tahir Whitehead", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Barkevious Mingo", "Duron Harmon", "Rashaan Melvin", "Teddy Bridgewater", "AJ McCarron", "Mike Evans", "DaQuan Jones", "Tre Boston", "Ricardo Allen", "Michael Thomas", "Zach Kerr", "Brandon Copeland", "Josh Hill", "Jameis Winston", "Mike Davis", "Malcom Brown", "Denzel Perryman", "Kwon Alexander", "Efe Obada", "Derrick Henry", "Michael Thomas", "Keanu Neal", "Erik Harris", "Nick Vannett", "Robby Anderson", "Stephen Weatherly", "Morgan Fox", "Corey Davis", "Haason Reddick", "Curtis Samuel", "Jonnu Smith", "Tanoh Kpassagnon", "Fabian Moreau", "Damontae Kazee", "Alex Armah", "Trey Hendrickson", "David Moore", "Taysom Hill", "Dan Arnold", "Sam Darnold", "Ito Smith", "Marcus Davenport", "Ian Thomas", "Qadree Ollison", "Scotty Miller", "Derrick Brown", "Richie Grant", "Jeremy Chinn", "Jaylinn Hawkins", "Chuba Hubbard", "Ian Book", "Kyle Pitts", "Dave Ragone", "Jaycee Horn", "Joe Tryon", "Payton Turner", "Tommy Tremble", "Jaelon Darden", "Pete Werner", "Darren Hall", "Mason Stokke"]}, {"author": "JPnightmare", "created_utc": 1628632982, "id": "p1zexd", "score": 1, "selftext": "**Quarterback (QB)**\n\n**Tier 1**\n\n1.

I used [overthecap](https://overthecap.com/free-agency/) for signings which is good but not the best so I am sure I missed some.  I also used [football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) for stats, [Ourlads](https://www.ourlads.com/nfldepthcharts/) for player relevance and past depth charts, and [pro football history](https://pro-football-history.com/) for coaching changes.

Nagy returns for what looks to be a make or break year for him.  Lazor gets a second shot at OC, and a big one with Fields/Dalton as QB. DC Chuck Pagano retired and they promoted safeties coach Sean Desai to DC.  \n2. The rest of mentionables: They hired Michael Pitre to be their RB coach. Michael Was the RB coach/lead recruiter for the Oregon Ducks.  Chris Rumph comes in as D line coach after a nice college career and broke into the NFL coaching ranks last year with the Texans.  A few other minor promotions from within etc.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Mitch Trubisky - Mitch Titties is gone and the ~~Andy Dalton~~ Justin Fields era begins.  We\u2019ll see how quickly Fields starts for the Bears. In the meantime Dalton can keep them afloat.\n2. CB Kyle Fuller - Coming off of a bad season by his standards but he is a tough loss to this secondary as he takes a lot of responsibility on. Replacing him is Desmond Trufant and uhh I\u2019m not sure which is very\u2026. Very not good.\n3. LT Charles Leno Jr. - A consistent starter that helped steady this line for years.  He\u2019s not an elite LT but he is definitely a good one.  Rookie 2nd rounder Teven Jenkins has big shoes to fill.\n4. DB Buster Skrine - More of a fill-in/depth guy but in conjunction with Fuller\u2019s departure this looks worse.\n5. WR/KR/PR Cordarrelle Patterson - A much bigger loss than people will give credit as he\u2019s a top 5 special teamer in the league and field position matters big time.\n6. RT Bobbie Massie - Spent the ends of both of the last 2 seasons hurt but hone he was on the field he was pretty good, he\u2019s 32 now so I get letting him go but important depth being missed when Leno Jr. leaves is tough.\n7. OG Rashad Coward - More important depth that had starts last season that\u2019s departing.  He\u2019s young though.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Andy Dalton - Shroedinger\u2019s QB, simultaneously average, unreliable, steady, and can win games.  Came in to be the starter until Fields dropped low enough for the bears to go up and get him. He\u2019ll be on a short leash if he starts the season and both he and Fields give Robinson a big bump, and I see Mooney as a stash until Fields is in.  Indirectly they both help out Montgomery since he will have some amount of less focus with Dalton and more volume initially then less focus if Fields is good.\n2. Edge Jeremiah Attachou - Some nice athletic LB depth\n3. DL Angelo Blackson - Very nice DL depth addition, he fits the role of rotational at best and that\u2019s exactly what the depth chart needs.\n4. LB Christian Jones. -  Another depth addition that was a starter but shouldn\u2019t be\n5. RB Damien Williams - He\u2019s not touching David Montgomery or Cohen\u2019s snaps so he\u2019s purely depth.\n6. WR Marquis Goodwin - The guy had a breakout season in 2017 then got hurt in 2018 and 2019 then opted out for covid.  The speedster will be behind Mooney presumably in his role.\n7. TE Jesse James - He\u2019ll push Kmet for snaps.\"\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. QB Justin Fields (R1) - He joins a team that just signed Dalton for 3 seasons but who knows how that\u2019ll play out.  Surely this kid will start with the way the league works today.  If/When that happens let\u2019s look at what we can try to expect.  Fields\u2019 had a plethora of different plays he excelled at in Ryan Day\u2019s offense at OSU. My understanding is that they did A LOT of repetition of a lot of different types of plays that would work at the college level.  There wasn\u2019t a heavy emphasis on one or two things like Lawrence. So being familiar with a plethora of plays is good, being able to study/learn and execute many different types of plays is definitely important, the big question is how much will the jump to the NFL affect him specifically?  While I\u2019m a believer in Fields long term success, I don\u2019t know if I fully believe he\u2019ll make the transition smoothly. We\u2019ll see though.  It\u2019s also worth noting that Nagy and Lazor employed different offenses for Trubisky and Foles so again it\u2019s hard to assume what to expect the offense with Fields to look like.  Fields had a connection with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson in 2020.  Olave is a typical Z receiver and very good route runner with decent size. Wilson was more or less a slot receiver that played outside as well. He also has decent size.  In 2019 he worked well with Olave as his primary target, but also BInjimen Victor the big target and KJ Hill an underneath route runner.  At Georgia he spread it out more or less and also had a connection with the TE. \n2. OT Teven Jenkins (R2) - Will have a lot of responsibility as a rookie but is scouted as NFL ready.  He\u2019ll be a boost to Montgomery I believe.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT/NT Eddie Goldman - He started for the Bears in the 5 seasons prior (with 1 injured season cut short) and his return will ensure their depth at the position and give them run d versatility in their schemes. \n\n**Assessment** *Well it\u2019s tough to really know what to expect out of the offense considering Lazor and Nagy are probably trying to custom fit one for each QB and haven\u2019t exactly had real success offensively.  Frankly I can\u2019t be sure we can trust them to produce an a great offense.  Either way we have plenty to be excited about because ARob and Montgomery immediately get upticks regardless of which QB starts the season because both are better than what they had last year. Mooney who showed a lot of flash in his rookie season has real potential for a sophomore breakout as well, I really like him if Fields gets in but I don\u2019t expect it right out of the gate.  Jimmy Graham probably remains the same tier 3 TD dependent TE at this stage in his career.  The defense remains very good as well but the secondary isn\u2019t as good as last season without Fuller.*\n\n#Lions\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. They fired Patricia (with good reason) and hired Dan Campbell, a character in his own right with a big time emphasis on toughness.  He was a tight end as a player and his history is as a TE coach (Hockenson giving me a hard-on). From 2011-2015 he was the Dolphins TE coach.  He worked with Fasano, Clay, and Jordan Cameron. Fasano was past his peak but hit his career high 5 TD seasons both of the years working with Campbell.  He notably coached Charles Clay to his 759 yard 6 TD season., as well as Clay\u2019s other decent year. Jordan Cameron wasn\u2019t really a talent and was phased out of the offense.  In 2015 he served as the interim head coach of the Dolphins when they fired Philbin after week 4.  The team went 5-7 while featuring Jarvis Landry as the main cog in the offense. Lamar Miller had a down season compared to the rest of the peak of his career.  Tannehill had a career high in yards with a good TD/INT ratio.  Parker and Ajayi were rookies supporting the offense along with Kenny Stills who failed to meet expectations after his time with the Saints. Instead Rishard Matthews had a bit of a breakout.  From there he went to the Saints as TE coach/Asst head coach from 2016 through 2020.  Unfortunately in that time frame he wasn\u2019t given too much top end talent at the TE position in that time frame.  Coby Fleener finished his career with NO, Ben Watson returned to NO, Josh Hill well\u2026 we don\u2019t talk about that, then more recently Taysom Hill but he barely lined up as TE, and last year he worked with 33 year old Jared Cook.  So here we are with a man likely licking his lips at the opportunity to work with top end talent in their prime with Hockenson.  He seems like he\u2019ll be a good coach and he said along the lines of how some coaches don\u2019t like hiring people who could end up replacing them but he didn\u2019t care he wanted to surround himself with as much talent and knowledge as possible and he did.\n2. He brought in Anthony Lynn who was the HC of the the last few seasons. Lynn was not a good head coach for a few reasons but he did lead the chargers to a 12-4 season in 2018 and had shown the other reasons in which he was hired for.  Before his time with the Chargers he was tied to Rex Ryan with the Jets and Bills as the RB coach and assistant head coach, he also was a RB coach for the Browns and Cowboys even before that.  This is probably a factor as to why the Chargers running backs were so solid through his tenure there.  A simplified take on how he did throughout all of those jobs is that when he left the run game always took a dive at all of those places.  It\u2019s also noteworthy that he helped the RBs on his teams find some of their more successful seasons.  You have to figure he\u2019ll place a heavy emphasis on a balanced offense and therefore I expect Swift to have some really nice numbers this season with Jamaal Williams as nice support.  The Chargers offenses also supported a number 1 receiver every year with viable number 2 in most seasons between Tyrell and Mike Williams successes\u2026 however the offenses had real talent and Whisenhunt was likely the mind behind the offenses and last year Steichen.\n3. For DC the team hired Aaron Glenn who had served as the Saints secondary coach for the past 4 seasons and their DB coach the season before that.   I\u2019m not entirely sure I get this one as the Saints had one of the worst secondaries throughout most of that tenure.  The key positive takeaway is that the Saints invested draft capital and traded for players in the secondary and he coached them up from being very bad to better.\n4. Back to the offensive side of the ball, the team also brings in Duce Staley to be Asst Head coach/RB Coach.  Staley has been with the Eagles organization since his coaching career started and became the RB coach in 2013, getting a bump in job title adding Asst Head Coach in 2018.  That 2013 season was McCoy\u2019s monster of a year with another nice one in 2014. After that he was given very little talent to work with in Demarco Murray and Ryan Matthews at the end of their careers, Blount, Josh Adams, until rookie Miles Sanders was decent.   Of course Sproles was around in support as well as Clement and Scott\u2026 those 3 guys are why I\u2019m excited for him to work with Swift as a similar player (and very much not like him as a player hah)\n5. Mark Brunell comes in as the QB coach. It\u2019s his first shot as a coach at the NFL level.  He\u2019s been the head coach at Episcopal School of Jacksonville, a prep school, for the last 8 years.\n6. Antwaan Randel El also joins the staff as the WR coach. He served as an offensive assistant coach to Bruce Arians the last 2 seasons.  \n7. They bring over a new Special Teams Coordinator, a new DB/D Pass game coordinator, and a few others on the d side of the ball. They retain their TE coach with good reason.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Matt Stafford - It\u2019ll be weird to see Goff in at QB in Stafford\u2019s wake.  Stafford had a 4000 yard season despite Golladay being injured most fo the year. He spread it to Jones, Hockenson, Amendola, and a bunch of others to get there.  \n2. WR Kenny Golladay - Missed a ton of time injured last season but the guy is a stud when healthy.  His departure along with Marvin Jones will be a serious gap to fill for Tyrell Williams (hurt last season), Brashad Perriman, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.\n3. WR Marvin Jones - Jones was the number 1 producer in the pass game last season and showed he still has game.  On his own his departure hurts but with Golladay being traded this is a really tough loss.\n4. S Duran Harmon - Starting safety that was decent considering how bad the lions secondary was in general.  I\u2019m not sure who they intend on filling that hole with.\n5. LB Christian Jones - Starting outside linebacker that had his struggles last year but losing a starter without a defined replacement isn\u2019t fun\n6. DT Danny Shelton - They lost him but they brought in what very much should be an upgrade to his last season\u2019s performance Michael Brockers who at 31 is going to have to prove he can do it on a DL without Aaron Donald.\n7. RB Adrian Peterson - It\u2019s Swift\u2019s backfield now and that\u2019s a good thing!\n8. TE Jesse James (FA) - Typically not worth mentioning but he\u2019s in here because his replacement is Darren Fells whom I like a lot as an improvement in the pass game.  I expect some 2 TE sets with him and Hockenson considering their WR depth.\n9. MLB Jarrad Davis - Lost his starting spot but still contributed\n10. Danny Amendola (FA) - On its own isn\u2019t a bad loss but again this is a guy who contributed to the pass game and is now gone.\n11. K Matt Prater - Prater\u2019s best days might be behind him considering his fg% was around 75% last season so this loss isn\u2019t a bad one.  However Randy Bullock isn\u2019t much better and lacks Prater\u2019s range, even in a dome. \n12. OL/OG Joe Dahl - Important offensive line depth that started 13 games in 2019\n13. OL/OG Oday Aboushi - Important offensive line depth that started 8 games last season\n14. DB Justin Coleman - Important secondary depth but on a bad secondary so he\u2019s replaceable but who are they replacing him with?  His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill.\n15. DB Darryl Roberts - Important secondary depth that started 5 games last season.   His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill as well.\n16. RB Kerryon Johnson -  See: Adrian Peterson\n17. CB Desmond Trufant - The vet was injured most of last year and struggled when healthy.\n18. LB Reggie Ragland - Important depth at the LB psoition, on its own it\u2019s ok but another case where someone else\u2019s departure it hurts more. The other in this instance being Christian Jones.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Jared Goff - Only time will tell if this move was the right one for the Lions. While Stafford is better and Goff has a serious cap hit getting two firsts and a 3rd in the deal makes it seemingly more than worth it.  This especially considering Goff has had success in the NFL, the question is how much of the success was his and how much was the system.  Either way Goff is coming over to a team without a true number 1 receiver.  They have Tyrell Williams coming off of a season on the IR with a shoulder injury and never proved he could be a WR1.  Brashad Perriman who presumably maxes out as a WR2, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.  That is a big step down from Kupp/Woods/Reynolds and previously Cooks.  So you have to figure Hockenson is going to have to be a huge factor for this offense to move.  \n2. DT/DL Michael Brockers - The vet comes in and instantly is a nice addition to the d line. His success has been next to Aaron Donald though so take it with a grain of salt since his responsibility is to hold it down while Donald tears it up.  The team doesn\u2019t have anyone like Donald but they did invest a 2nd and a 3rd round pick to the DL.\n3. WR Tyrell Williams - He\u2019s getting another shot at being a number 1 receiver after a disappointing 2019 and sat out 2020 with an injury.  He\u2019s got the freshlegs but who even knows what to expect.\n4. Jamaal Williams - Joins an offense that will have to have a heavy emphasis on the run and he has proven he can be a 1B. In this instance he\u2019s not going to be a 1B but more a complimentary back since he and Swift are very different runners.  If the run game is good in general he\u2019ll be a top tier handcuff.\n5. WR Breshad Perriman - After a disappointing start to his career he\u2019s proven he can be an NFL receiver in some capacity but he probably maxes out as a WR2.  His addition is important to a team thin an WR talent. \n6. TE Darren Fells - I kind of love this pickup - it\u2019s a subtle addition that could mean a lot to the offensive playbook as he has decent hands and is an okay route runner.  I\u2019m bullish in saying that I see him as a TE handcuff that has some production of his own the way Boyle was for Fleener on the Andrew Luck Colts offense.\n7. LB Alex Anzalone - The angel haired inside LB joins a team that needs depth and fills in nicely hopefully. \n8. QB Tim Boyle - He replaces Chase Daniel as the backup QB. I\u2019m not sure why they paid him as much as they did as the backup but hey he\u2019s a backup QB.\n9. K Randy Bullock - Maybe an upgrade to Prater in accuracy, not by much though, definitely doesn\u2019t have the power of Prater\u2026 but he\u2019s an NFL kicker.\n10. CB Quinten Dunbar - Much needed CB depth, he\u2019s dealt with injuries recently\n11. S Dean Marlowe - Purely depth with no startability upside but they NEED it in the secondary.\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OG Penei Sewell (R1) - Tough to say you found a deal at the 4th overall pick but the Lions thought they got one at that spot and they just might have.  This guy is going to pave the way for what clearly will be an offense that relies on the run.\n2. DT Levi Nowuzurike (R2) A much needed addition to the D line.  Figure he\u2019ll compete to start out of the gate\n3. DT Alim McNeill (R3) - Some competition on this D line for snaps will probably be a good thing.  It\u2019s clear what the staff want to do in bulking up in the trenches (Eagles model)\n4. CB Ifeatu Melifonwu (R3) - Much needed addition to the secondary. He could compete for snaps out of the get go.\n5. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (R4) - I think he plays like a slightly shorter/weaker Keenan Allen as he\u2019s shifty but his quickness is more a product of his ability to see/find space mores than his feet.  He very well could have an immediate impact on this offense since there isn\u2019t probowl talent in front of him. Not to mention his amazing name makes for great fantasy team names. He\u2019s a dynasty target for sure.\n6. LB Derrick Barnes (R4) - Another guy who might just compete for snaps from day 1.  I figure he\u2019ll be rotational but could earn it in the tail. End of the season.\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Geronimo Allison - Wouldn\u2019t be mentioned if they still had Golladay but yeah I feel like he has a shot to make an impact considering the rest of the names in that WR room.\n\n**Assessment** *Here\u2019s what I can say with confidence.  BIG buy on Hockenson with the value of TE in fantasy, and definitely invest in Deandre Swift.  After that I\u2019m really not sure what to say here.  The team\u2019s defense was bottom tier in 2020 and lost a lot of players that they didn\u2019t replace.. a lot think it\u2019s addition by subtraction and I can buy that considering they did add to the line but we\u2019ll see.  All eyes on Goff but the offense can\u2019t be totally inept outside of Hockenson and the run game.  Jamaal Williams is a great handcuff to own.  Amon-Ra probably won\u2019t be viable until later in the season in redraft leagues.  Tyrell Williams and Brashad Perriman are bust/boom drafts more than boom/bust.  Goff is in for a challenge this season.*\n\n#Packers\n\n- **Personnel**  \n\n1. Lafleaur and Hackett remain HC and OC and there\u2019s no reason to think they shouldn\u2019t be.  Mike Pettine was not brought back as DC after he brought them from pretty bad to pretty decent.  They hired Joe Barry who was assistant head coach/linebackers coach of the Rams from 2017-2020. Before that he was the Redskins DC.  He also had a 2 year stint as the Lions DC that ended abruptly after their 0-16 season.  Anyways his last stint as DC with the Redskins he did well enough.  He brought them from the bottom of the league to the middle in terms of defensive statistics for the 2 seasons he was there.  His time with the Rams is tough to gauge as an assistant head coach/LB coach but obviously he did at least okay.\n2. The rest are essentially some job title improvements and responsibility distribution amongst the staff that was already in place.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Aaron Rodgers - DEFINITELY PRE-EMPTIVE but if the guy is going pretty much not going to be your starting QB he\u2019s essentially gone.  Things could change but we\u2019ll see. If Rodgers doesn\u2019t play for the Packers I expect the offense and the team to fall apart fairly quickly.  Davante is still going to produce no matter who\u2019s throwing the ball but after that I expect a serious hit to Aaron Jones when the pass threat isn\u2019t as deadly.  Even if the volume is greater the quality is likely too much of a drop-off unless Jordan Love turns out to be as good of a rookie as say Herbert was last season.\n2. C Corey Linsley - The stud center signed with the Chargers.  2019 2nd rounder Elgton Jenkins will compete with 2021 2nd rounder Josh Myers for the job.  By default they will be a downgrade at least this season.\n3. RT Ricky Wagner (FA) - The veteran was released despite starting 9 games fairly well last season.  He did split snaps throughout the year though.  Billy Turner is getting the endorsement to step up for the position next season. Which is fine.\n4. RB Jamaal Williams - He steadily helped the offense tick throughout all 4 seasons. He never achieved the goal of being a starter but he was top tier as a 1B.  I do believe AJ Dillon will be more than capable of filling his shoes. If Rodgers is their QB I actually have Dillon as having a potential to steal starting reps from Jones.\n5. ILB Christian Kirksey - Starting LB who doesn\u2019t have a clear cut replacement so his loss will be felt a little.. however he wasn\u2019t very good last season so next man up.\n6.  QB Tim Boyle - Actually not a good loss considering the current shenanigans\u2026 however Blake muthafuckin Bortles signed with the Packers so that\u2019s a nice step up for their 3rd QB who very well could be their 2nd.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Blake Bortles - That\u2019s it. He\u2019s literally the only free agent they signed from outside the organization.  It\u2019s a good signing and it\u2019s probably due to cap issues.  He\u2019s a good signing but they have holes to fill. \n- **Relavant Draft**\n1. CB Eric Stokes (R1) - He\u2019ll push Kevin King for a starting position opposite of Jaire Alexander.\n2. C Josh Myers (R2) - He\u2019ll compete with Elgton Jenkins to start.\n3. WR Amari Rodgers (R3) - Likely an instant starter and an automatic late round flier if Rodgers plays for the Packers this season.\n4. RT Royce Newman (R4) - Good depth at a position that needed depth\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Devin Funchess - I guess relevant but probably not\n**Assessment** *It all rides on Rodgers, plain and simple.  If he plays then buy high on Davante, at value for Aaron Jones, definitely take shots on AJ Dillon and Amari Rodgers. If Aaron doesn\u2019t play then well\u2026 just Davante at what his new value would be and Aaron Jones if he falls.*\n\n#Vikings\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. A bunch of promotion and shuffling from within happened. However there is one important note.  Gary Kubiak retired and his son Klint is now the Offensive Coordinator.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything worth taking away from that.  Maybe someone who\u2019s a diehard vikings fan and goes to training camp can weigh in on what to expect different from Gary. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. LT Riley Reiff - A veteran of the game and still is an NFL starter but his prime was a few years ago.  They drafted Christian Darrisaw in the first round to replace him.\n2. S/DB Anthony Harris - He wasn\u2019t a standout but definitely a piece to the puzzle for the secondary.  His replacement being Xavier Woods could be a step down but Xavier was probably the best piece of the Cowboys secondary and he\u2019s joining a team that has more pieces around him.\n3. LB Eric Wilson - Another starter lost on the defensive side but Wilson left fans wanting more considering Anthony Barr is the guy he was filling in for.  Barr returns from the IR this year to start again, but how much time does he have left?\n4. DE/Edge Ifeadi Odenigbo - He also got his first shot as a starter in the NFL and disappointed last season. They brought in Stephen Weatherly to help fill the hole but they also drafted guys in the 3rd/4th this year and DJ Wonnum in the 4th last year so it\u2019ll be a bit of a competition.\n5. DT Shamar Stephen - He started 15 and 16 games for the Vikings the last 2 seasons.  Like Harris he wasn\u2019t a standout but he was a piece to the puzzle.  However they have Michael Pierce returning from the Covid Opt Out list to step up.\n6. K Dan Bailey - He had one of the worst FG% in the league and so the team moved on from him.  South African Greg Joseph is competing with UDFA Riley Patterson for the position.\n7. DT Jaleel Johnson - Another starter lost. This one however is probably more of a case of addition by subtraction\u2026. Also the fact that they brought in Dalvin Tomlinson to fill the hole is a HUGE improvement\n8. QB Sean Mannion - Kellen Mond\u2019s arrival meant Mannion was out as the backup QB.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. DT Dalvin Tomlinson - A big time pickup for the front 7.  Him with Pierce will help stabilize the heart of the D to give it the opportunity return to their former success.\n2. CB Patrick Peterson - The veteran still has talent and his addition also helps the defensive side of the ball.\n3. DL Sheldon Richardson - Another very nice addition to the front 7 to help the Vikings recapture the image they once had.\n4. CB Bashaud Breeland - a decent pickup for their secondary.\n5. S Xavier Woods -  As with many in the Cowboys secondary he had his struggles but he did show ability and he joins a defense with more pieces around him so I expect a nice improvement to both the front 7 and the secondary next season.\n6. WR Dede Westbrook - I think he has a good chance to compete for the 3rd receiver spot behind Theilen and JJ.\n7. Edge Stephen Weatherly - He got his first opportunity to be the starter and wasn\u2019t exactly what the Panthers were looking for statistically and he finished the season on the IR. He\u2019s in competition with some young guns for the starting spot.\n8. LB Nick Vigil - Important depth behind Barr.\n9. CB Mackensie Alexander - Important depth\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OT Christian Darrisaw (R1) - A day 1 starter at LT will have some growing pains but he\u2019s very talented.  Reiff\u2019s replacement has big shoes to fill.\n2. OG Wyatt Davis (R3) - He won\u2019t have to start out of the gate but could earn snaps\n3. QB Kellen Mond (R3) - I like him as a backup with potential in the future\n4. DE Patrick Jones II (R3) - Will compete to start this season\n5. MLB Chazz Surrat (R3) - Important depth behind Kendricks\n6. DE Janarius Robinson (R4) - Will compete to start the season\n7. S Camryn Bynum (R4) - Important depth behind Xavier Woods\n8. RB Kene Nwangwu (R4) - I think this was a draft based on measurables. He\u2019ll have 2 seasons to develop behind Cook and Mattison when Mattison will become a FA.\n9. TE Zach Davidson (R5) - He could end up being a receiving threat down the line but he isn\u2019t built to be an NFL TE yet. He has height but not functional strength/size. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT Michael Pierce - It was tough for the team not to have him available last season after bringing him in to steady the line but this year having him around along with Tomlinson will be huge, literally.\n\n**Assessment** *The team obviously focused on their defense in a big way but also their O line.  The main thing to focus on is Klint Kubiak and what that means for the offense. He\u2019ll need to command the same respect as his father.  Regardless it\u2019ll be safe to assume nice season from Cook, Theilen, and Jefferson. They don\u2019t really have a TE for the sake of moving the ball so it\u2019s those 3 alone that will be the workhorses as they have been.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes NFC North", "created": 1628554151.0, "players": ["Aaron Rodgers", "Adrian Peterson", "Chase Daniel", "Danny Amendola", "Jared Cook", "Matt Prater", "Jimmy Graham", "Patrick Peterson", "Andy Dalton", "Buster Skrine", "Dan Bailey", "Lamar Miller", "Michael Brockers", "Randy Bullock", "Kenny Stills", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Keenan Allen", "Sheldon Richardson", "Desmond Trufant", "Blake Bortles", "Jarvis Landry", "Anthony Barr", "Christian Jones", "Aaron Donald", "Kyle Fuller", "Christian Kirksey", "Bashaud Breeland", "Shamar Stephen", "Damien Williams", "Josh Hill", "Darren Fells", "Danny Shelton", "Eddie Goldman", "Devin Funchess", "Sean Mannion", "Jesse James", "Breshad Perriman", "Darryl Roberts", "Angelo Blackson", "Dean Marlowe", "Tyrell Williams", "Justin Coleman", "Anthony Harris", "Jared Goff", "Mackensie Alexander", "Reggie Ragland", "Nick Vigil", "Geronimo Allison", "Stephen Weatherly", "Michael Pierce", "Mike Williams", "Jamaal Williams", "Dede Westbrook", "Jarrad Davis", "Kevin King", "Kenny Golladay", "Xavier Woods", "Dalvin Tomlinson", "Aaron Jones", "Ifeadi Odenigbo", "Jaleel Johnson", "Eric Wilson", "Alex Anzalone", "Taysom Hill", "Kerryon Johnson", "Josh Adams", "Christian Kirk", "Jaire Alexander", "Greg Joseph", "Tim Boyle", "David Montgomery", "Miles Sanders", "Jordan Love", "AJ Dillon", "Kellen Mond", "Janarius Robinson", "Binjimen Victor", "Justin Fields", "Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Chris Olave", "Amari Rodgers", "Dan Campbell", "Marvin Jones", "Duce Staley", "Aaron Glenn", "Mike Williams", "Patrick Jones II", "Eric Stokes", "Camryn Bynum", "Alim McNeill", "Ifeatu Melifonwu", "Garrett Wilson", "Derrick Barnes", "Kene Nwangwu", "Patrick Jones II", "Riley Patterson", "Zach Davidson"]}, {"author": "TJTrapJesus", "created_utc": 1629286226, "id": "p6p9wu", "score": 1, "selftext": "You can fill out however many players you want. Basically how it works is you fill out your top 40, then subtract points for how far off you were.   \n\nExample:   \n\n- If you have Mahomes at #1 and he actually ends up at #5, it's -4 points (1-5). If you have him at #5 and he ends up at #1, it's still -4 points as the difference.      \n- If you have Mahomes at #1 and he ends up at #1, it's 0 points.   \n- If you put any player in the top 40 and they don't end up being on the list, you subtract 101 from whichever rank you had them at. So if you have Mahomes at #1, yet he doesn't make the top 100, you get -100 points (1-101). If you have Mahomes at #40 and he doesn't make the top 100, you get -61 points (40-101).   \n- The theoretical best score is 0 points if you get everything exactly right, and the theoretical worst score is -3,220 if you either name 40 players who all didn't make the top 100, or just don't fill it out.     \n\nHere are my choices (for reference, 41-100 are the players that have already been listed on the NFL Top 100):   \n\n**1.

An MCL sprain in week 2, then 2 separate high ankle sprains in weeks 6 and 15. In that time he ran the ball 104 times for 521 yards and 2 TDs, he also pulled in 16 balls on 19 targets and 1 TD. Raheem was a solid runner while on the field amassing 5 YPA. The key thing is the 8 missed games due to injury, which has been the story of the 29-year-olds career. Mostert has never been able to stay healthy and has gotten him on a short leash. The 49ers organization spent a 3rd round pick on ex Ohio state running back Trey Sermon who is favored to take over sooner rather than later this season. There's a chance Raheem can fend off Sermon but it\u2019s a very big gamble, one that I don\u2019t see paying off.\n\n*Melvin Gordon \u2013 ADP 69, RB30*\n\nThe Denver Broncos signed Gordon to a two-year, $16 million dollar contract last year, and moved on from Phillip Linsday this year. Although these two things make Gordon sound more appealing the organization also brought in a young stud RB in Javonte Williams. You would think a Big new contract would equal workload but last year that wasn\u2019t the case. In 15 games Gordon rushed 215 times just missing the 1,000-yard mark while gathering 9 TDs, through the air Melvin was targeted 44 times and caught 32 for 158 yards and a TD. Phillip Lindsay stole 118 carries last year for 500 yards and a TD. It\u2019s thought that Gordon will fill more of Lindsay\u2019s old role this year with Williams taking the heavier side of the work. \n\n*James Robinson ADP 70, RB 31*\n\nThis is a tough one because James Robinson has done everything right. He seized his opportunity last year with the Jags and absolutely delivered, if you had him on your fantasy team last year there\u2019s a good chance you won a championship. The problem is that nothing is guaranteed this year for Robinson, with the arrival of Urban Myer and Trevor Lawrence the offense is going to play completely different. Travis Etienne and Carlos Hyde were added because Myer wanted to \u201cadd depth\u201d to the position. Etienne is being looked at as a big breakout back this season which is forcing Robinsons ADP down in a big way. Last year Robinson took 87% of the carries last year, opportunity that\u2019s unheard of in today's game. He played 14 games last season and with that opportunity, he rushed 240 times for 1070 yards and 7 TDs and caught the ball 49 times on 60 targets for 3 TDs. Even with Etienne and Hyde being in the mix Robinson may not be a bad pickup at this price. \n\n*Michael Carter ADP 71, RB 32*\n\nOne of the most exciting rookie running backs this year is Michael Carter. This guy has a Ton of upside and could have a huge breakout year. The Jets offense may not be the steaming pile that we\u2019ve seen in recent years now that Adam Gase is out. Currently, he\u2019s projected to have 154 carries for 645 yards and 3 touchdowns with 31 receptions and a receiving TD. The only man standing in Carter\u2019s way is banged up Tevin Coleman who has missed a lot of time in the last two seasons. Carter has a ton of upside and is being looked at as the primary option in the offense. If he continues to impress at camp, he could be a great late-round value this year.", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Midround RB breakdown", "created": 1628995247.0, "players": ["Carlos Hyde", "Tevin Coleman", "Raheem Mostert", "Phillip Lindsay", "Travis Etienne", "Trey Sermon", "James Robinson", "Trevor Lawrence", "Michael Carter", "Javonte Williams"]}, {"author": "hallach_halil", "created_utc": 1628891082, "id": "p3uwxn", "score": 1, "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7vl5nk7t4h71.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e48ae8d19fcdf6537f1dd2047c2f05317fc8dde3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I have done the last seven years and as the actual reason I  started with my page, I have put together my personal list of the NFL\u2019s  Top 100. This was originally designed to be a ranking of the top 100  players in the league, regardless of position, for the upcoming season.  And while this has more and more become a comparison of resumes and  altered its criteria, in the spirit of what this was intended to be, I  listed what I thought were the very best players, in relation to how  good they are at their position coming into 2021. What I changed this  year was actually putting ratings on these players \u2013 sort of Madden  style \u2013 and one by one incorporating them into the list, while debating  back and forth when multiple guys shared the same number.\n\nThere are six names to start off with, who didn\u2019t qualify for my  list. I believe they all deserve to be on it, but I just didn\u2019t know  where to put them, because of how long it\u2019s been since we\u2019ve seen them  on the field, how often they\u2019ve gotten hurt recently or because we just  don\u2019t know if/when we will see them play again.\n\nI also added the 30 names that just missed the cut. So it\u2019s almost a  top 130, because I always have a tough time leaving those names off, but  I feel pretty good about the ultimate rankings that I put together  here.\n\nFor analysis, just click on the video, where I work my way from the bottom to the top!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbNE0KxkrwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbNE0KxkrwE)  \n\n\nThe official countdown premieres two days from now, but I\u2019m filming this here on August 4th  \u2013 just in case any players were to suffer an injury or some other news  coming out, that would change the availability of certain players. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n### Did not qualify:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijc078tlt4h71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c59e459a108cb587959379d6a88c53aa29ce94d6\n\n \n\nMichael Thomas \u2013 foot surgery in late July leads to uncertainty of when he\u2019ll be available\n\nDerwin James \u2013 only five total games over these last 2 years combined\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. \u2013 played in just 25 total games over these last four years\n\nDanielle Hunter \u2013 scary back surgery before last season even started, is something I want to see play out first\n\nMitchell Schwartz \u2013 currently still a free agent, who has hinted at possible retirement\n\nDeshaun Watson \u2013 for obvious reason, he\u2019s a top 15 player in the league otherwise\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# The list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezqd01ert4h71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=480f999d1fb85967293927e35f8ec71924b7c140\n\n \n\n1.

If you're at all interested the list of newly signed players are [here](https://i.imgur.com/k46cL1s.png) and contract details can be found [here](https://overthecap.com/salary-cap/kansas-city-chiefs/). So for this section I'm just going to talk about the players coming in who are noteworthy.\n\n|Player|Position|Old Team|Length|Salary\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Kyle Long|OG|Bears|1 Year|1.5M .4MG\n|Joe Thuney|OG|Patriots|5 Year|$90M $46.89MG\n|Jarran Reed|DT|Seahawks|1 Year|$5.5M 1MG\n\n**Trades**\n\n|Chiefs Receive|Ravens Receive|\n|--|--|\n|Orlando Brown|Chiefs 2021 1st|\n|Ravens 2021 2nd|Chiefs 2021 3rd|\n|Ravens 2021 6th|Chiefs 2021 4th|\n||Chiefs 2021 6th|\n\n|Chiefs Receive|Vikings Receive|\n|--|--|\n|Mike Hughes|Chiefs 2022 6th|\n|Vikings 2022 7th||\n\n**Basically The entire O-line**\n\nReplacing your entire offensive line is not usually the most sound strategy for winning football but it honestly seems warranted here. I think they might be the only team in the NFL with 5 new starters at each of their O-line spots which is spooky and I think early in the year we may see some struggles in protections. 2 of the Lineman haven't played football in more than a year, Lucas Niang and Laurent Duvernay-Tardif(great human being) both Opt-outs last year. 2 really great players but only acquired this year, Orlando Brown and Joe Thuney but you're going to need to sign Brown to a long-term extension this year and Thuney is already making a huge amount over the next 5 years. The center starter on paper is 2nd round pick Creed Humphrey or Austin Blythe who is just ok. Kyle Long is a piece I'm not sure where he fits, I think LDT will start at RG but it's pretty up in the air who will be starting. My philosophy when it comes to O-line is that you're literally only as good as your weakest piece which I think will be whoever plays center this year. I'm pretty certain this is a B overall o-line who is going to start the season at a D or a C as they kinda get their \"sea-legs\" and get comfortable with their new team.\n\nA necessary but scary B\n\n**Jarran Reed**\n\nThis was a surprise and I'm sure he got offers for more money but he's a great run stopping DT who will make the great Chris Jones' job easier.\n\nA+\n\n**Mike Hughes**\n\nLow cost veteran but this is not a very impactful move.\n\nC+\n\n**Sammy Watkins**\n\nSammy was a good receiver on the chiefs when he was healthy. He was almost never healthy.\n\nA+\n\n**Anthony Sherman**\n\nAs a Patriots fan I've had to deal with the loss of James Develin where Bill has tried literally everything to try and find a replacement, including just slotting in linebackers at fullback. Ask any non-casual Chiefs fan and you'll know how big of a loss this is.\n\nSad/10\n\n\n---\n\n###Draft\n\n|Round|Number|Player|Position|School\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|2|58|Nick Bolton|LB|Missouri\n|2|63|Creed Humphrey|C|Oklahoma\n|4|144|Joshua Kaindoh|DE|Florida State\n|5|162|Noah Gray|TE|Duke\n|5|181|Cornell Powell|WR|Clemson\n|6|226|Trey Smith|G|Tennessee\n\n**Nick Bolton**\n\nBolton is a slower than average LB but he was highly productive in college, especially in the run game. He's a very prototypical inside linebacker but his lack of top end speed could be a detriment when trying to tackle speedier backs.\n\nB+\n\n**Creed Humphrey**\n\nThis is a great pick, he was the Big 12 lineman of the year 2 years in a row and the only reason he dropped is because he doesn't necessarily have elite lateral speed or overwhelming strength but I always value production over those things and he had that in droves in college.\n\nA\n\n**Joshua Kaindoh**\n\nHe has ideal size and average speed but this pick will basically be all about health.\n\nB-\n\n**Noah Grey**\n\nLack of production in college but has great size and speed.\n\nC\n\n**Cornell Powell**\n\nGood stats in his one year with significant play, but didn't beat out any upperclassman while he was a freshman or sophomore. Not a significantly impressive athlete but he should be pretty reasonable depth.\n\nC+\n\n**Trey Smith**\n\nNot really much I can say about him, he's a later round guard from Tennessee. Probably fine.\n\nProbably fine/10\n\n###Undrafted Players\n|Player|Position|School\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Zayne Anderson|S|BYU\n|**Dicaprio Bootle**|CB|Nebraska\n|Shane Buechele|QB|SMU \n|Marlon Character|CB|Louisville\n|Riley Cole|LB|South Alabama\n|Malik Herring|DE|Georgia\n|Devon Key|S|Western Kentucky\n|Jaylon McClain-Sapp|CB|Marshall\n|Manny Patterson|CB|Maine\n\n---\n\n###Projected Starting Lineup\n\n* Patrick Mahomes QB\n* Clyde Edwards-Helaire RB\n* Michael Burton FB\n* Travis Kelce and Blake Bell TEs\n* Tyreek Hill Mecole Hardman Demarcus Robinson WRs\n* Orlando Brown LT\n* Joe Thuney LG\n* Austin Blythe/Creed Humphrey C\n* Laurent Duvernay-Tardif/Kyle Long RG\n* Lucas Niang RT\n* Alex Okafor Chris Jones Jarran Reed Frank Clark DL\n* Anthony Hitchens Willie Gay Jr. Nick Bolton LB\n* L'Jarius Sneed Charvarius Ward Deandre Baker CBs\n* Daniel Sorensen Tyrann Mathieu S\n* Harrison Butker K\n* Tommy Townsend P\n* Byron Pringle KR\n* Mecole Hardman PR\n\n**Patrick Mahomes**\n\nPatrick Mahomes is good at football.\n\n**Clyde Edwards-Helaire**\n\nCED was a great piece for the Chiefs last year but the addition of Leveon Bell really screwed me over in my fantasy league.\n\n**Travis Kelce**\n\nIf there is still anyone that claims that Kittle is the best tight end in the league just remind them who over the past 7 years has only missed two games and who has missed eleven games over the past 4. Availability is the most important thing in the league.\n\n**Tyreek Hill**\n\nTyreek Hill is fast and good at football.\n\n**Orlando Brown**\n\nOrlando Brown is a great player, a 1st is a lot to give up but if he is the perennial pro bowler as it looks like he will be this will be well worth it. \n\n**L'jarrus Sneed**\n\nHe was excellent last year as a rookie and will look for an expanded role this next year. Really overplayed my C+ grade last year.\n\n**Frank Clark**\n\nClark was a key piece of this defense and will continue to be a major factor that other teams will have to worry about every week.\n\n**Tyrann Mathieu**\n\nHoney Badger had another excellent season last year and will be the center piece of this defense alongside Chris Jones.\n\n**Chris Jones**\n\nJones is a top 5 DT in the league and if it were not for Aaron Donald he would be in the conversation for best DT in the league.\n\n---\n\n###Position Group Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nPosition groups:\n\n* QB\n\nPatrick Mahomes was and still is the most dangerous QB in the entire league. A+\n\n* Backfield\n\nPretty good unit but not spectacular. B\n\n* WR\n\nGreat overall unit. The loss of Sammy Watkins isn't great but you basically didn't have him half the time anyway. B+\n\n* TE\n\nTravis Kelce is the best TE in the league and that means this spot is probably the best in the league. No for sure number 2 but that doesn't really matter. A+\n\n* OL\n\nI talked about this earlier but this will be a little question mark. Great talent but need to see how they mesh. C-(weeks 1-5) B(after that)\n\n* DL\n\nThe best part of this defense, solid all around and it will be tough to run on the Chiefs. A-\n\n* LB\n\nNot a great group but they are pretty young and we will see how they perform as the season progresses. C-\n\n* Secondary\n\nI've been pretty negative the last couple years but this group honestly isn't bad, nothing special overall but definitely not a weakness. B-\n \n* Special Teams\n\nGreat all around. A-\n\n---\n\n###Schedule Predictions\n\n**Chiefs vs Cleveland Browns**\n\nI can't believe I'm predicting this but I think this game is going to be pretty close. They have an excellent D-line and if my prediction that the chiefs oline will struggle early this will be a pretty tough game. Flip a coin.\n\n**Chiefs @ Ravens**\n\nRavens are good but the chiefs are definitely better at QB WR TE DL and the Ravens are only definitely better at LB and CB. Plus Reid is better than Harbaugh. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs vs Chargers**\n\nChargers are pretty interesting young team but this is still easily a chiefs win. Expect spags to bring the heat on Herbert. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs @ Eagles**\n\nI'm sure I'll get some flak but I think the Eagles might be the worst team in the league if Jalen Hurt isn't good. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs vs Bills**\n\nBills are good but Mahomes is better than Allen. I feel like I should have more to say but I don't, Chiefs are just the better overall team. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs @ Football Team**\n\nI think this will be closer than people expect but this is still a Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs @ Titans**\n\nTitans are great and are on paper one of the best teams in the AFC but the Chiefs have a better overall team. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs vs Giants**\n\nI'm pretty certain Daniel Jones isn't going to have a Josh Allen transformation. Chiefs win\n\n**Chiefs vs Packers**\n\nPackers are great but there is a blueprint for how to beat the which is to control the flow of the game and be aggressive. If they can stop Aaron Jones that'll be the key. Flip a coin.\n\n**Chiefs @ Raiders**\n\nRaiders have a fun offense but that defense will still be one of the worst in the league. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs vs Cowboys**\n\nJust like the Raiders the Cowboys are fun on offense but will still not be great on defense. Chiefs win. \n\n**Chiefs vs Broncos**\n\nBroncos are definitely more interesting than last year but they're still not as good as the chiefs and this is off of a bye. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs vs Raider**\n\nBasically the same as above. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs @ Chargers**\n\nSame as above and basically still at home. Chiefs win\n\n**Chiefs vs Steelers**\n\nI think the Steelers might not be very good this year, but I've been wrong before. Tomlin is a great coach but Ben is going to be an issue for this team and it will be not easy to hide his flaws. Chiefs win\n\n**Chiefs @ Bengals**\n\nBengals will be better than last year but are still a year or two away from contention. Chiefs win.\n\n**Chiefs @ Broncos**\n\nSame as above but higher up. Chiefs win\n\n\nFinal tally 15-2 \n\nI'm going to hedge and say that you win one of the 2 coin flips and a random game you should probably win so 15-2 is my final tally.\n\n---\n\n###Training Camp Battles to watch\n\nBasically who will end up starting Center and Right guard as both of those positions are up for grabs.\n\n---\n\n###Discuss Offensive and Defensive Schemes\n\n**West Coast**\n\nThe west coast offense is a pass first offense that utilizes speed and WR cuts to disrupt game flow. The west coast offense uses shot gun heavily and was first popularized by Bill Walsh during the 80's while he was the head coach of the 49ers.\n\n**Base 4-3**\n\nBase 4-3 uses 4 Lineman and 3 Linebackers in their base packages as opposed to using the reverse in a 3-4 scheme.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nChiefs are great and will be the on paper best team in the AFC. They have a great opportunity to repeat as AFC champions but can they make that super bowl win into a dynasty, only time will tell.\n\nI upload pretty infrequently to my youtube channel about various random NFL stuff but I'm going to be making a video about the time a NBA legend sued an NFL player and he changed his name because of it.

Nagy returns for what looks to be a make or break year for him.  Lazor gets a second shot at OC, and a big one with Fields/Dalton as QB. DC Chuck Pagano retired and they promoted safeties coach Sean Desai to DC.  \n2. The rest of mentionables: They hired Michael Pitre to be their RB coach. Michael Was the RB coach/lead recruiter for the Oregon Ducks.  Chris Rumph comes in as D line coach after a nice college career and broke into the NFL coaching ranks last year with the Texans.  A few other minor promotions from within etc.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Mitch Trubisky - Mitch Titties is gone and the ~~Andy Dalton~~ Justin Fields era begins.  We\u2019ll see how quickly Fields starts for the Bears. In the meantime Dalton can keep them afloat.\n2. CB Kyle Fuller - Coming off of a bad season by his standards but he is a tough loss to this secondary as he takes a lot of responsibility on. Replacing him is Desmond Trufant and uhh I\u2019m not sure which is very\u2026. Very not good.\n3. LT Charles Leno Jr. - A consistent starter that helped steady this line for years.  He\u2019s not an elite LT but he is definitely a good one.  Rookie 2nd rounder Teven Jenkins has big shoes to fill.\n4. DB Buster Skrine - More of a fill-in/depth guy but in conjunction with Fuller\u2019s departure this looks worse.\n5. WR/KR/PR Cordarrelle Patterson - A much bigger loss than people will give credit as he\u2019s a top 5 special teamer in the league and field position matters big time.\n6. RT Bobbie Massie - Spent the ends of both of the last 2 seasons hurt but hone he was on the field he was pretty good, he\u2019s 32 now so I get letting him go but important depth being missed when Leno Jr. leaves is tough.\n7. OG Rashad Coward - More important depth that had starts last season that\u2019s departing.  He\u2019s young though.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Andy Dalton - Shroedinger\u2019s QB, simultaneously average, unreliable, steady, and can win games.  Came in to be the starter until Fields dropped low enough for the bears to go up and get him. He\u2019ll be on a short leash if he starts the season and both he and Fields give Robinson a big bump, and I see Mooney as a stash until Fields is in.  Indirectly they both help out Montgomery since he will have some amount of less focus with Dalton and more volume initially then less focus if Fields is good.\n2. Edge Jeremiah Attachou - Some nice athletic LB depth\n3. DL Angelo Blackson - Very nice DL depth addition, he fits the role of rotational at best and that\u2019s exactly what the depth chart needs.\n4. LB Christian Jones. -  Another depth addition that was a starter but shouldn\u2019t be\n5. RB Damien Williams - He\u2019s not touching David Montgomery or Cohen\u2019s snaps so he\u2019s purely depth.\n6. WR Marquis Goodwin - The guy had a breakout season in 2017 then got hurt in 2018 and 2019 then opted out for covid.  The speedster will be behind Mooney presumably in his role.\n7. TE Jesse James - He\u2019ll push Kmet for snaps.\"\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. QB Justin Fields (R1) - He joins a team that just signed Dalton for 3 seasons but who knows how that\u2019ll play out.  Surely this kid will start with the way the league works today.  If/When that happens let\u2019s look at what we can try to expect.  Fields\u2019 had a plethora of different plays he excelled at in Ryan Day\u2019s offense at OSU. My understanding is that they did A LOT of repetition of a lot of different types of plays that would work at the college level.  There wasn\u2019t a heavy emphasis on one or two things like Lawrence. So being familiar with a plethora of plays is good, being able to study/learn and execute many different types of plays is definitely important, the big question is how much will the jump to the NFL affect him specifically?  While I\u2019m a believer in Fields long term success, I don\u2019t know if I fully believe he\u2019ll make the transition smoothly. We\u2019ll see though.  It\u2019s also worth noting that Nagy and Lazor employed different offenses for Trubisky and Foles so again it\u2019s hard to assume what to expect the offense with Fields to look like.  Fields had a connection with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson in 2020.  Olave is a typical Z receiver and very good route runner with decent size. Wilson was more or less a slot receiver that played outside as well. He also has decent size.  In 2019 he worked well with Olave as his primary target, but also BInjimen Victor the big target and KJ Hill an underneath route runner.  At Georgia he spread it out more or less and also had a connection with the TE. \n2. OT Teven Jenkins (R2) - Will have a lot of responsibility as a rookie but is scouted as NFL ready.  He\u2019ll be a boost to Montgomery I believe.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT/NT Eddie Goldman - He started for the Bears in the 5 seasons prior (with 1 injured season cut short) and his return will ensure their depth at the position and give them run d versatility in their schemes. \n\n**Assessment** *Well it\u2019s tough to really know what to expect out of the offense considering Lazor and Nagy are probably trying to custom fit one for each QB and haven\u2019t exactly had real success offensively.  Frankly I can\u2019t be sure we can trust them to produce an a great offense.  Either way we have plenty to be excited about because ARob and Montgomery immediately get upticks regardless of which QB starts the season because both are better than what they had last year. Mooney who showed a lot of flash in his rookie season has real potential for a sophomore breakout as well, I really like him if Fields gets in but I don\u2019t expect it right out of the gate.  Jimmy Graham probably remains the same tier 3 TD dependent TE at this stage in his career.  The defense remains very good as well but the secondary isn\u2019t as good as last season without Fuller.*\n\n#Lions\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. They fired Patricia (with good reason) and hired Dan Campbell, a character in his own right with a big time emphasis on toughness.  He was a tight end as a player and his history is as a TE coach (Hockenson giving me a hard-on). From 2011-2015 he was the Dolphins TE coach.  He worked with Fasano, Clay, and Jordan Cameron. Fasano was past his peak but hit his career high 5 TD seasons both of the years working with Campbell.  He notably coached Charles Clay to his 759 yard 6 TD season., as well as Clay\u2019s other decent year. Jordan Cameron wasn\u2019t really a talent and was phased out of the offense.  In 2015 he served as the interim head coach of the Dolphins when they fired Philbin after week 4.  The team went 5-7 while featuring Jarvis Landry as the main cog in the offense. Lamar Miller had a down season compared to the rest of the peak of his career.  Tannehill had a career high in yards with a good TD/INT ratio.  Parker and Ajayi were rookies supporting the offense along with Kenny Stills who failed to meet expectations after his time with the Saints. Instead Rishard Matthews had a bit of a breakout.  From there he went to the Saints as TE coach/Asst head coach from 2016 through 2020.  Unfortunately in that time frame he wasn\u2019t given too much top end talent at the TE position in that time frame.  Coby Fleener finished his career with NO, Ben Watson returned to NO, Josh Hill well\u2026 we don\u2019t talk about that, then more recently Taysom Hill but he barely lined up as TE, and last year he worked with 33 year old Jared Cook.  So here we are with a man likely licking his lips at the opportunity to work with top end talent in their prime with Hockenson.  He seems like he\u2019ll be a good coach and he said along the lines of how some coaches don\u2019t like hiring people who could end up replacing them but he didn\u2019t care he wanted to surround himself with as much talent and knowledge as possible and he did.\n2. He brought in Anthony Lynn who was the HC of the the last few seasons. Lynn was not a good head coach for a few reasons but he did lead the chargers to a 12-4 season in 2018 and had shown the other reasons in which he was hired for.  Before his time with the Chargers he was tied to Rex Ryan with the Jets and Bills as the RB coach and assistant head coach, he also was a RB coach for the Browns and Cowboys even before that.  This is probably a factor as to why the Chargers running backs were so solid through his tenure there.  A simplified take on how he did throughout all of those jobs is that when he left the run game always took a dive at all of those places.  It\u2019s also noteworthy that he helped the RBs on his teams find some of their more successful seasons.  You have to figure he\u2019ll place a heavy emphasis on a balanced offense and therefore I expect Swift to have some really nice numbers this season with Jamaal Williams as nice support.  The Chargers offenses also supported a number 1 receiver every year with viable number 2 in most seasons between Tyrell and Mike Williams successes\u2026 however the offenses had real talent and Whisenhunt was likely the mind behind the offenses and last year Steichen.\n3. For DC the team hired Aaron Glenn who had served as the Saints secondary coach for the past 4 seasons and their DB coach the season before that.   I\u2019m not entirely sure I get this one as the Saints had one of the worst secondaries throughout most of that tenure.  The key positive takeaway is that the Saints invested draft capital and traded for players in the secondary and he coached them up from being very bad to better.\n4. Back to the offensive side of the ball, the team also brings in Duce Staley to be Asst Head coach/RB Coach.  Staley has been with the Eagles organization since his coaching career started and became the RB coach in 2013, getting a bump in job title adding Asst Head Coach in 2018.  That 2013 season was McCoy\u2019s monster of a year with another nice one in 2014. After that he was given very little talent to work with in Demarco Murray and Ryan Matthews at the end of their careers, Blount, Josh Adams, until rookie Miles Sanders was decent.   Of course Sproles was around in support as well as Clement and Scott\u2026 those 3 guys are why I\u2019m excited for him to work with Swift as a similar player (and very much not like him as a player hah)\n5. Mark Brunell comes in as the QB coach. It\u2019s his first shot as a coach at the NFL level.  He\u2019s been the head coach at Episcopal School of Jacksonville, a prep school, for the last 8 years.\n6. Antwaan Randel El also joins the staff as the WR coach. He served as an offensive assistant coach to Bruce Arians the last 2 seasons.  \n7. They bring over a new Special Teams Coordinator, a new DB/D Pass game coordinator, and a few others on the d side of the ball. They retain their TE coach with good reason.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Matt Stafford - It\u2019ll be weird to see Goff in at QB in Stafford\u2019s wake.  Stafford had a 4000 yard season despite Golladay being injured most fo the year. He spread it to Jones, Hockenson, Amendola, and a bunch of others to get there.  \n2. WR Kenny Golladay - Missed a ton of time injured last season but the guy is a stud when healthy.  His departure along with Marvin Jones will be a serious gap to fill for Tyrell Williams (hurt last season), Brashad Perriman, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.\n3. WR Marvin Jones - Jones was the number 1 producer in the pass game last season and showed he still has game.  On his own his departure hurts but with Golladay being traded this is a really tough loss.\n4. S Duran Harmon - Starting safety that was decent considering how bad the lions secondary was in general.  I\u2019m not sure who they intend on filling that hole with.\n5. LB Christian Jones - Starting outside linebacker that had his struggles last year but losing a starter without a defined replacement isn\u2019t fun\n6. DT Danny Shelton - They lost him but they brought in what very much should be an upgrade to his last season\u2019s performance Michael Brockers who at 31 is going to have to prove he can do it on a DL without Aaron Donald.\n7. RB Adrian Peterson - It\u2019s Swift\u2019s backfield now and that\u2019s a good thing!\n8. TE Jesse James (FA) - Typically not worth mentioning but he\u2019s in here because his replacement is Darren Fells whom I like a lot as an improvement in the pass game.  I expect some 2 TE sets with him and Hockenson considering their WR depth.\n9. MLB Jarrad Davis - Lost his starting spot but still contributed\n10. Danny Amendola (FA) - On its own isn\u2019t a bad loss but again this is a guy who contributed to the pass game and is now gone.\n11. K Matt Prater - Prater\u2019s best days might be behind him considering his fg% was around 75% last season so this loss isn\u2019t a bad one.  However Randy Bullock isn\u2019t much better and lacks Prater\u2019s range, even in a dome. \n12. OL/OG Joe Dahl - Important offensive line depth that started 13 games in 2019\n13. OL/OG Oday Aboushi - Important offensive line depth that started 8 games last season\n14. DB Justin Coleman - Important secondary depth but on a bad secondary so he\u2019s replaceable but who are they replacing him with?  His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill.\n15. DB Darryl Roberts - Important secondary depth that started 5 games last season.   His loss with Harmon is a tougher pill as well.\n16. RB Kerryon Johnson -  See: Adrian Peterson\n17. CB Desmond Trufant - The vet was injured most of last year and struggled when healthy.\n18. LB Reggie Ragland - Important depth at the LB psoition, on its own it\u2019s ok but another case where someone else\u2019s departure it hurts more. The other in this instance being Christian Jones.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Jared Goff - Only time will tell if this move was the right one for the Lions. While Stafford is better and Goff has a serious cap hit getting two firsts and a 3rd in the deal makes it seemingly more than worth it.  This especially considering Goff has had success in the NFL, the question is how much of the success was his and how much was the system.  Either way Goff is coming over to a team without a true number 1 receiver.  They have Tyrell Williams coming off of a season on the IR with a shoulder injury and never proved he could be a WR1.  Brashad Perriman who presumably maxes out as a WR2, and rookie Amon-Ra St. Brown.  That is a big step down from Kupp/Woods/Reynolds and previously Cooks.  So you have to figure Hockenson is going to have to be a huge factor for this offense to move.  \n2. DT/DL Michael Brockers - The vet comes in and instantly is a nice addition to the d line. His success has been next to Aaron Donald though so take it with a grain of salt since his responsibility is to hold it down while Donald tears it up.  The team doesn\u2019t have anyone like Donald but they did invest a 2nd and a 3rd round pick to the DL.\n3. WR Tyrell Williams - He\u2019s getting another shot at being a number 1 receiver after a disappointing 2019 and sat out 2020 with an injury.  He\u2019s got the freshlegs but who even knows what to expect.\n4. Jamaal Williams - Joins an offense that will have to have a heavy emphasis on the run and he has proven he can be a 1B. In this instance he\u2019s not going to be a 1B but more a complimentary back since he and Swift are very different runners.  If the run game is good in general he\u2019ll be a top tier handcuff.\n5. WR Breshad Perriman - After a disappointing start to his career he\u2019s proven he can be an NFL receiver in some capacity but he probably maxes out as a WR2.  His addition is important to a team thin an WR talent. \n6. TE Darren Fells - I kind of love this pickup - it\u2019s a subtle addition that could mean a lot to the offensive playbook as he has decent hands and is an okay route runner.  I\u2019m bullish in saying that I see him as a TE handcuff that has some production of his own the way Boyle was for Fleener on the Andrew Luck Colts offense.\n7. LB Alex Anzalone - The angel haired inside LB joins a team that needs depth and fills in nicely hopefully. \n8. QB Tim Boyle - He replaces Chase Daniel as the backup QB. I\u2019m not sure why they paid him as much as they did as the backup but hey he\u2019s a backup QB.\n9. K Randy Bullock - Maybe an upgrade to Prater in accuracy, not by much though, definitely doesn\u2019t have the power of Prater\u2026 but he\u2019s an NFL kicker.\n10. CB Quinten Dunbar - Much needed CB depth, he\u2019s dealt with injuries recently\n11. S Dean Marlowe - Purely depth with no startability upside but they NEED it in the secondary.\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OG Penei Sewell (R1) - Tough to say you found a deal at the 4th overall pick but the Lions thought they got one at that spot and they just might have.  This guy is going to pave the way for what clearly will be an offense that relies on the run.\n2. DT Levi Nowuzurike (R2) A much needed addition to the D line.  Figure he\u2019ll compete to start out of the gate\n3. DT Alim McNeill (R3) - Some competition on this D line for snaps will probably be a good thing.  It\u2019s clear what the staff want to do in bulking up in the trenches (Eagles model)\n4. CB Ifeatu Melifonwu (R3) - Much needed addition to the secondary. He could compete for snaps out of the get go.\n5. WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (R4) - I think he plays like a slightly shorter/weaker Keenan Allen as he\u2019s shifty but his quickness is more a product of his ability to see/find space mores than his feet.  He very well could have an immediate impact on this offense since there isn\u2019t probowl talent in front of him. Not to mention his amazing name makes for great fantasy team names. He\u2019s a dynasty target for sure.\n6. LB Derrick Barnes (R4) - Another guy who might just compete for snaps from day 1.  I figure he\u2019ll be rotational but could earn it in the tail. End of the season.\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Geronimo Allison - Wouldn\u2019t be mentioned if they still had Golladay but yeah I feel like he has a shot to make an impact considering the rest of the names in that WR room.\n\n**Assessment** *Here\u2019s what I can say with confidence.  BIG buy on Hockenson with the value of TE in fantasy, and definitely invest in Deandre Swift.  After that I\u2019m really not sure what to say here.  The team\u2019s defense was bottom tier in 2020 and lost a lot of players that they didn\u2019t replace.. a lot think it\u2019s addition by subtraction and I can buy that considering they did add to the line but we\u2019ll see.  All eyes on Goff but the offense can\u2019t be totally inept outside of Hockenson and the run game.  Jamaal Williams is a great handcuff to own.  Amon-Ra probably won\u2019t be viable until later in the season in redraft leagues.  Tyrell Williams and Brashad Perriman are bust/boom drafts more than boom/bust.  Goff is in for a challenge this season.*\n\n#Packers\n\n- **Personnel**  \n\n1. Lafleaur and Hackett remain HC and OC and there\u2019s no reason to think they shouldn\u2019t be.  Mike Pettine was not brought back as DC after he brought them from pretty bad to pretty decent.  They hired Joe Barry who was assistant head coach/linebackers coach of the Rams from 2017-2020. Before that he was the Redskins DC.  He also had a 2 year stint as the Lions DC that ended abruptly after their 0-16 season.  Anyways his last stint as DC with the Redskins he did well enough.  He brought them from the bottom of the league to the middle in terms of defensive statistics for the 2 seasons he was there.  His time with the Rams is tough to gauge as an assistant head coach/LB coach but obviously he did at least okay.\n2. The rest are essentially some job title improvements and responsibility distribution amongst the staff that was already in place.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Aaron Rodgers - DEFINITELY PRE-EMPTIVE but if the guy is going pretty much not going to be your starting QB he\u2019s essentially gone.  Things could change but we\u2019ll see. If Rodgers doesn\u2019t play for the Packers I expect the offense and the team to fall apart fairly quickly.  Davante is still going to produce no matter who\u2019s throwing the ball but after that I expect a serious hit to Aaron Jones when the pass threat isn\u2019t as deadly.  Even if the volume is greater the quality is likely too much of a drop-off unless Jordan Love turns out to be as good of a rookie as say Herbert was last season.\n2. C Corey Linsley - The stud center signed with the Chargers.  2019 2nd rounder Elgton Jenkins will compete with 2021 2nd rounder Josh Myers for the job.  By default they will be a downgrade at least this season.\n3. RT Ricky Wagner (FA) - The veteran was released despite starting 9 games fairly well last season.  He did split snaps throughout the year though.  Billy Turner is getting the endorsement to step up for the position next season. Which is fine.\n4. RB Jamaal Williams - He steadily helped the offense tick throughout all 4 seasons. He never achieved the goal of being a starter but he was top tier as a 1B.  I do believe AJ Dillon will be more than capable of filling his shoes. If Rodgers is their QB I actually have Dillon as having a potential to steal starting reps from Jones.\n5. ILB Christian Kirksey - Starting LB who doesn\u2019t have a clear cut replacement so his loss will be felt a little.. however he wasn\u2019t very good last season so next man up.\n6.  QB Tim Boyle - Actually not a good loss considering the current shenanigans\u2026 however Blake muthafuckin Bortles signed with the Packers so that\u2019s a nice step up for their 3rd QB who very well could be their 2nd.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Blake Bortles - That\u2019s it. He\u2019s literally the only free agent they signed from outside the organization.  It\u2019s a good signing and it\u2019s probably due to cap issues.  He\u2019s a good signing but they have holes to fill. \n- **Relavant Draft**\n1. CB Eric Stokes (R1) - He\u2019ll push Kevin King for a starting position opposite of Jaire Alexander.\n2. C Josh Myers (R2) - He\u2019ll compete with Elgton Jenkins to start.\n3. WR Amari Rodgers (R3) - Likely an instant starter and an automatic late round flier if Rodgers plays for the Packers this season.\n4. RT Royce Newman (R4) - Good depth at a position that needed depth\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n1. WR Devin Funchess - I guess relevant but probably not\n**Assessment** *It all rides on Rodgers, plain and simple.  If he plays then buy high on Davante, at value for Aaron Jones, definitely take shots on AJ Dillon and Amari Rodgers. If Aaron doesn\u2019t play then well\u2026 just Davante at what his new value would be and Aaron Jones if he falls.*\n\n#Vikings\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. A bunch of promotion and shuffling from within happened. However there is one important note.  Gary Kubiak retired and his son Klint is now the Offensive Coordinator.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything worth taking away from that.  Maybe someone who\u2019s a diehard vikings fan and goes to training camp can weigh in on what to expect different from Gary. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. LT Riley Reiff - A veteran of the game and still is an NFL starter but his prime was a few years ago.  They drafted Christian Darrisaw in the first round to replace him.\n2. S/DB Anthony Harris - He wasn\u2019t a standout but definitely a piece to the puzzle for the secondary.  His replacement being Xavier Woods could be a step down but Xavier was probably the best piece of the Cowboys secondary and he\u2019s joining a team that has more pieces around him.\n3. LB Eric Wilson - Another starter lost on the defensive side but Wilson left fans wanting more considering Anthony Barr is the guy he was filling in for.  Barr returns from the IR this year to start again, but how much time does he have left?\n4. DE/Edge Ifeadi Odenigbo - He also got his first shot as a starter in the NFL and disappointed last season. They brought in Stephen Weatherly to help fill the hole but they also drafted guys in the 3rd/4th this year and DJ Wonnum in the 4th last year so it\u2019ll be a bit of a competition.\n5. DT Shamar Stephen - He started 15 and 16 games for the Vikings the last 2 seasons.  Like Harris he wasn\u2019t a standout but he was a piece to the puzzle.  However they have Michael Pierce returning from the Covid Opt Out list to step up.\n6. K Dan Bailey - He had one of the worst FG% in the league and so the team moved on from him.  South African Greg Joseph is competing with UDFA Riley Patterson for the position.\n7. DT Jaleel Johnson - Another starter lost. This one however is probably more of a case of addition by subtraction\u2026. Also the fact that they brought in Dalvin Tomlinson to fill the hole is a HUGE improvement\n8. QB Sean Mannion - Kellen Mond\u2019s arrival meant Mannion was out as the backup QB.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. DT Dalvin Tomlinson - A big time pickup for the front 7.  Him with Pierce will help stabilize the heart of the D to give it the opportunity return to their former success.\n2. CB Patrick Peterson - The veteran still has talent and his addition also helps the defensive side of the ball.\n3. DL Sheldon Richardson - Another very nice addition to the front 7 to help the Vikings recapture the image they once had.\n4. CB Bashaud Breeland - a decent pickup for their secondary.\n5. S Xavier Woods -  As with many in the Cowboys secondary he had his struggles but he did show ability and he joins a defense with more pieces around him so I expect a nice improvement to both the front 7 and the secondary next season.\n6. WR Dede Westbrook - I think he has a good chance to compete for the 3rd receiver spot behind Theilen and JJ.\n7. Edge Stephen Weatherly - He got his first opportunity to be the starter and wasn\u2019t exactly what the Panthers were looking for statistically and he finished the season on the IR. He\u2019s in competition with some young guns for the starting spot.\n8. LB Nick Vigil - Important depth behind Barr.\n9. CB Mackensie Alexander - Important depth\n\n- **Relavant Draft**\n\n1. OT Christian Darrisaw (R1) - A day 1 starter at LT will have some growing pains but he\u2019s very talented.  Reiff\u2019s replacement has big shoes to fill.\n2. OG Wyatt Davis (R3) - He won\u2019t have to start out of the gate but could earn snaps\n3. QB Kellen Mond (R3) - I like him as a backup with potential in the future\n4. DE Patrick Jones II (R3) - Will compete to start this season\n5. MLB Chazz Surrat (R3) - Important depth behind Kendricks\n6. DE Janarius Robinson (R4) - Will compete to start the season\n7. S Camryn Bynum (R4) - Important depth behind Xavier Woods\n8. RB Kene Nwangwu (R4) - I think this was a draft based on measurables. He\u2019ll have 2 seasons to develop behind Cook and Mattison when Mattison will become a FA.\n9. TE Zach Davidson (R5) - He could end up being a receiving threat down the line but he isn\u2019t built to be an NFL TE yet. He has height but not functional strength/size. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** \n\n1. DT Michael Pierce - It was tough for the team not to have him available last season after bringing him in to steady the line but this year having him around along with Tomlinson will be huge, literally.\n\n**Assessment** *The team obviously focused on their defense in a big way but also their O line.  The main thing to focus on is Klint Kubiak and what that means for the offense. He\u2019ll need to command the same respect as his father.  Regardless it\u2019ll be safe to assume nice season from Cook, Theilen, and Jefferson. They don\u2019t really have a TE for the sake of moving the ball so it\u2019s those 3 alone that will be the workhorses as they have been.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes NFC North", "created": 1628554151.0, "players": ["Aaron Rodgers", "Adrian Peterson", "Chase Daniel", "Danny Amendola", "Jared Cook", "Matt Prater", "Jimmy Graham", "Patrick Peterson", "Andy Dalton", "Buster Skrine", "Dan Bailey", "Lamar Miller", "Michael Brockers", "Randy Bullock", "Kenny Stills", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Keenan Allen", "Sheldon Richardson", "Desmond Trufant", "Blake Bortles", "Jarvis Landry", "Anthony Barr", "Christian Jones", "Aaron Donald", "Kyle Fuller", "Christian Kirksey", "Bashaud Breeland", "Shamar Stephen", "Damien Williams", "Josh Hill", "Darren Fells", "Danny Shelton", "Eddie Goldman", "Devin Funchess", "Sean Mannion", "Jesse James", "Breshad Perriman", "Darryl Roberts", "Angelo Blackson", "Dean Marlowe", "Tyrell Williams", "Justin Coleman", "Anthony Harris", "Jared Goff", "Mackensie Alexander", "Reggie Ragland", "Nick Vigil", "Geronimo Allison", "Stephen Weatherly", "Michael Pierce", "Mike Williams", "Jamaal Williams", "Dede Westbrook", "Jarrad Davis", "Kevin King", "Kenny Golladay", "Xavier Woods", "Dalvin Tomlinson", "Aaron Jones", "Ifeadi Odenigbo", "Jaleel Johnson", "Eric Wilson", "Alex Anzalone", "Taysom Hill", "Kerryon Johnson", "Josh Adams", "Christian Kirk", "Jaire Alexander", "Greg Joseph", "Tim Boyle", "David Montgomery", "Miles Sanders", "Jordan Love", "AJ Dillon", "Kellen Mond", "Janarius Robinson", "Binjimen Victor", "Justin Fields", "Amon-Ra St. Brown", "Chris Olave", "Amari Rodgers", "Dan Campbell", "Marvin Jones", "Duce Staley", "Aaron Glenn", "Mike Williams", "Patrick Jones II", "Eric Stokes", "Camryn Bynum", "Alim McNeill", "Ifeatu Melifonwu", "Garrett Wilson", "Derrick Barnes", "Kene Nwangwu", "Patrick Jones II", "Riley Patterson", "Zach Davidson"]}, {"author": "fritothedog", "created_utc": 1629215371, "id": "p66ice", "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone, we are on the precipice of the 2021 NFL season. Throughout the season I write a weekly post reviewing the best unowned players that week. This has put the spotlight on a few players that we may otherwise miss. However, Fantasy Football is easy when you already know the scores. The real game of fantasy football is guessing the future. With that said I wanted to try out this introductory post so we can collectively look ahead to the Best Unowned Team for 2021. \n\nAs always, for the purposes of this post I will use %Owned from Yahoo and we will use 0.5 PPR scoring. The roster format is QB, RB1, RB2, WR1, WR2, TE, Flex, D/ST, K. The unowned team consists of players owned 5% of leagues or less.\n\n# Looking Back\n\nWhat better way to look ahead, than to start by looking back? I took over this post in 2018 and after 3 seasons I have noticed a few themes that show up on this team. \n\n## Here are the players that have been on the best unowned them the at least 3 times over the last three years:\n\n  |\\*\\*Rank\\*\\*|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|1|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|6|75|D/ST|\n\n|2|Jason Sanders - MIA|5|81|K|\n\n|3|David Moore - SEA|5|80.6|WR|\n\n|4|Atlanta Falcons|5|75|D/ST|\n\n|5|Dustin Hopkins - WAS|5|58|K|\n\n|6|New York Giants|5|58|D/ST|\n\n|7|Miami Dolphins|5|51|D/ST|\n\n|8|Buffalo Bills|5|48|D/ST|\n\n|9|Oakland Raiders|5|46|D/ST|\n\n|10|Josh Allen, BUF|4|99.78|QB|\n\n|11|Ryan Fitzpatrick - VAR|4|97.96|QB|\n\n|12|Zach Pascal - IND|4|77.2|WR|\n\n|13|Jeff Wilson Jr. - SF|4|75.6|RB|\n\n|14|Steven Sims Jr. - WAS|4|64.9|WR|\n\n|15|Willie Snead IV - BAL|4|62.8|WR|\n\n|16|Cairo Santos - VAR|4|55|K|\n\n|17|Devontae Booker - VAR|4|52.9|RB|\n\n|18|Jordan Wilkins - IND|4|52.3|RB|\n\n|19|Daniel Carlson - LV|4|49|K|\n\n|20|Kyle Juszczyk - SF|4|45.6|RB|\n\n|21|New York Jets|4|45|D/ST|\n\n|22|Gus Edwards- BAL|4|44.6|RB|\n\n|23|Kyle Allen - VAR|3|58.2|QB|\n\n|24|Dante Pettis, SF|3|56|WR|\n\n|25|Brandon Allen - VAR|3|54.04|QB|\n\n|26|Isaiah McKenzie - BUF|3|53.8|WR|\n\n|27|Hunter Renfrow - OAK|3|51.4|WR|\n\n|28|Tajae Sharpe - TEN|3|47.2|WR|\n\n|29|Anthony Firkser - TEN|3|44.1|TE|\n\n|30|Sam Ficken - NYJ|3|44|K|\n\n|31|Marcus Johnson - IND|3|43.1|WR|\n\n|32|Andy Isabella - ARI|3|42.7|WR|\n\n|33|Ricky Seals-Jones - CLE|3|42.3|TE|\n\n|34|Robert Foster,BUF|3|42.3|WR|\n\n|35|Brandon McManus - DEN|3|42|K|\n\n|36|Kalen Ballage - VAR|3|41.7|RB|\n\n|37|Dallas Goedert, PHI|3|41.5|TE|\n\n|38|Marvin Hall - WR - VAR|3|40.2|FLEX|\n\n|39|Darren Fells - VAR|3|39.1|TE|\n\n|40|Stephen Hauschka - BUF|3|39|K|\n\n|41|Ryquell Armstead - JAX|3|37.4|RB|\n\n|42|Brian Hill - ATL|3|37|RB|\n\n|43|Kapri Bibbs, WAS|3|34.7|RB|\n\n|44|Cameron Brate - TB|3|34.6|TE|\n\n|45|Wayne Gallman Jr. - NYG|3|30.7|RB|\n\n|46|Jacksonville Jaguars|3|30|D/ST|\n\n|47|Josh Adams - NYJ|3|29.3|RB|\n\nThe first thing that stands out to me are there are a lot of defenses at the top. This speaks to the difficulty in predicting that position. 4 of Tampa Bay\u2019s 6 appearances occurred in 2018. All 5 of Buffalo\u2019s appearances occurred in 2018. This year, both of them are being drafted in most leagues. Then you see Atlanta, Miami, NYG, and Oakland up high on the list and no one is rushing out to get them. The Dolphins have been underrated as a defense though, they were the 4th ranked fantasy defense last year. Perhaps they will join the ranks of drafted Defenses like TB and BUF.\n\n## Here\u2019s a list of everyone who has made the list each of the last three years:\n\n|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|Jason Sanders - MIA|5|81|K|\n\n|David Moore - SEA|5|80.6|WR|\n\n|Dustin Hopkins - WAS|5|58|K|\n\n|Miami Dolphins|5|51|D/ST|\n\n|Ryan Fitzpatrick - VAR|4|97.96|QB|\n\n|Zach Pascal - IND|4|77.2|WR|\n\n|Jeff Wilson Jr. - SF|4|75.6|RB|\n\n|Jordan Wilkins - IND|4|52.3|RB|\n\n|Gus Edwards- BAL|4|44.6|RB|\n\n|Isaiah McKenzie - BUF|3|53.8|WR|\n\n|Anthony Firkser - TEN|3|44.1|TE|\n\n|Kalen Ballage - VAR|3|41.7|RB|\n\n|Darren Fells - VAR|3|39.1|TE|\n\n|Wayne Gallman Jr. - NYG|3|30.7|RB|\n\nJason Sanders, David Moore and Dustin Hopkins are the only individual players (i.e. not D/ST) with 5 appearances on the best unowned team. \n\nDavid Moore seems to be a capable WR but has been stuck behind some combination of Doug Baldwin, Tyler Lockett, and D.K. Metcalf. Now that he is in Carolina, he is behind D.J. Moore and Robby Anderson, as well as camp reports saying rookie Terrace Marshall is outplaying him. My guess is more of the same, he\u2019ll pop onto the team once or twice this year.\n\nIf you use Kickers, I want to talk about Dustin Hopkins. We all have high hopes for McLaurin and Gibson. Logan Thomas and Curtis Samuel should be good too. All of this is elevated by the addition of Fitzpatrick. Hopkins could actually be a top 10 kicker this year if that offense takes a step forward like it should. Dustin Hopkins has been consistent enough to make this team each of the last three years and has been a top 10 kicker in the past. \n\nThere are 2 players here I don\u2019t want to see on the list this year. Let\u2019s do what we can to make sure that Ryan Fitzpatrick and Anthony Firkser are over 5% owned all year this year. With that said let me make a prediction: Fitzpatrick starts weeks 1-4. He plays poorly and Heinecke takes over. Fitzpatrick\u2019s ownership plummets. Heinecke starts for 4 weeks and then plays poorly week 7 and 8. Fitzpatrick comes out and lights it up after their bye in week 10 when his ownership is 2%. \n\nI also want to highlight Isaiah McKenzie. With John Brown\u2019s departure Gabe Davis and Cole Beasley are getting all the attention. You could do worse than throwing McKenzie into your flex, as he should benefit from those vacated targets as well. The presence of Robert Foster in 2018 also leads to the fact that this offense can support several WRs, especially as long as the run game is an afterthought in Buffalo.\n\nThe presence of Jeff Wilson on this list is not a reminder to take him in any drafts, it is a reminder that SF RBs do not stay healthy, and whichever are the top two any given week should return value. We also never know when one of the top two SF RBs is going to be Kyle Jusczyk. I am curious if Saleh and Mike LaFleur can replicate that RB Value with the Jets backfield. The RB rooms are even similarly built, veteran starter (Coleman/Mostert), Rookie draft pick (Carter/Sermon), performs well with opportunity (Josh Adams/Jeff Wilson) and others who can flash (Ty Johnson and La\u2019Mical Perine/Elijah Mitchell).\n\nKalen Ballage, how do you keep doing this? Every year you manage to make the team. He\u2019ll probably manage to do it again this year. Right now, it seems unlikely behind Najee, Snell and McFarland, but perhaps I should stop betting against Ballage.\n\n## Here\u2019s a list of 2019 rookies who made the list each of their first two years in the league:\n\nPerhaps more accurately, they made the list the first two years they recorded any stats, starting in 2019. \n\n|\\*\\*Player\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*POS\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|Andy Isabella - ARI|3|42.7|WR|\n\n|Dwayne Haskins Jr. - WAS|2|37.9|QB|\n\n|Darwin Thompson - KC|2|36.9|RB|\n\n|Olamide Zaccheaus - ATL|2|34.1|WR|\n\n|Byron Pringle - KC|2|32.5|WR|\n\n|Greg Ward - PHI|2|31.1|WR|\n\n|Reggie Bonnafon - CAR|2|28.1|RB|\n\n|Ty Johnson - VAR|2|26.4|RB|\n\n|Benny Snell Jr. - PIT|2|18.3|RB|\n\nThe name I want to talk about here is Byron Pringle. Mecole Hardman has not made this team once, likely because his ownership was always above 5%. Pringle however has been getting some camp hype and is surpassing Demarcus Robinson for WR3 in the high-powered KC offense. Pringle could be valuable if Hill or Hardman miss any time, and those speedsters tend to come up with hamstring issues at least once a year.\n\nOlamide Zaccheaus is another interesting name. Julio Jones is out and that leaves plenty of targets to spread. Ridley is assuredly elite this year, Gage should be solid as well but Zaccheaus has already shown flashes with Julio there and could be a bit more consistent even with the addition of Pitts.\n\n# Here are the top ten in total points for each of the last three years\n\n||\\*\\*2018 Team Member\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*Pos\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n\n|1|Josh Allen, BUF|4|99.78|QB|\n\n|2|Dante Pettis, SF|3|56|WR|\n\n|3|Buffalo Bills|5|48|D/ST|\n\n|4|Brock Osweiler, MIA|2|45.76|QB|\n\n|5|C.J.

He was still being doubted going into the 2019 and even some into 2020, now he is a top QB in the league and getting paid to boot. He led Buffalo to have 4 players in the top 10 by score on this team (if you count the defense).\n\nI never understood the hype on Pettis, but now I see he actually produced some in 2018, his rookie year. I had forgotten all about that. I doubt he flourishes with the Giants, but I wouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised to see him pop up again on this list.\n\n||\\*\\*2019 Team Member\\*\\*|\\*\\*Appearances\\*\\*|\\*\\*Total Score\\*\\*|\\*\\*Pos\\*\\*|\n\n:--|:--|--:|--:|:--|\n\n|1|Steven Sims Jr. - WAS|4|64.9|WR|\n\n|2|Hunter Renfrow - OAK|3|51.4|WR|\n\n|3|Jeff Driskel - DET|2|46.02|QB|\n\n|4|New York Giants|3|44|D/ST|\n\n|5|Case Keenum - WAS|2|43.62|QB|\n\n|6|Ricky Seals-Jones - CLE|3|42.3|TE|\n\n|7|Brandon McManus - DEN|3|42|K|\n\n|8|Ryan Griffin - NYJ|2|42|TE|\n\n|9|Tampa Bay Buccaneers|2|39|D/ST|\n\n|10|Ryquell Armstead - JAX|3|37.4|RB|\n\nNo one here really jumps out to me.

His inclusion on this team each of the last 3 years speaks to that being true. However, camp reports suggest Corey Clement has been outperforming Booker in camp behind the injured Saquon. Either one could play early in the season and be valuable until Saquon returns.\n\n# So what do we learn from all this?\n\n1. Defenses and kickers are hard to predict, but there will always be good options to stream. \n2. Although the passing volume is low in Baltimore, Willie Snead carved out some decent games. I believe Hollywood, Watkins and Bateman are all more talented than Snead. Eventually one will emerge, and I think they will find some consistency this year at the WR position.\n3. Nelson Agholor could actually have a decent year. I suspect him to operate as the Patriots\u2019 WR1. He\u2019s been a fantasy WR2 a couple of times, and I tend to think that is his floor this year. The Patriots dealt with more opt outs than any other team last year. I suspect last year was an outlier for them, and they will return to being a good team. If Cam struggles again, the rookie Mac Jones has been promising in camp. Whoever emerges in NE should return value, I am guessing Agholor, Jonnu Smith, and Damien Harris will all be relevant this year, James White may return to PPR form as well.\n4. Muddled situations produce fantasy opportunity\u2026 If you guess right. See Jeff Wilson, Willie Snead, Darren Fells, Greg Ward. All of them had crowded position groups from the start, or an injury to a starter led to a committee. Consistency isn\u2019t there, but the opportunity to hit big for one week exists in these situations. If you are in a deep league and need a bye week fill in, these may be places to look.\n5. There are no bad players in the NFL, all of them are talented. If given the opportunity any of them can produce any given week. One broken play can lead to a long TD to Zay Jones. Ryquell Armstead could score a TD if given the ball on the 1 yd line for one play. In fantasy football it is consistency that increases ownership. The biggest predictor of consistency is number of touches. Included in this idea is backup QBs can still produce decent weeks.\n6. Lastly, a more meta deduction. The best unowned team is a far more valuable post in weeks 1 through 3 than later in the year. Those first few weeks can highlight players that will be featured in their offenses. By weeks 3 or 4, those players will be owned. Look for the players that could produce consistently. The ones with a path to consistent touches and the talent to capitalize. Later on in the year, be careful not to get sucked in by the one hit wonders. Injuries can propel backups to new opportunities but other than that, consistent players don\u2019t often emerge in the latter half of the season. \n\n# Who is making the team this year?\n\nI will start with the caveat that it seems %Owned isn\u2019t updated on Yahoo since the end of last season so I am also looking at Sleeper for %Rostered. It\u2019s hard to guess what the ownership will be during week 1. Bold players are possible inclusions on this team based on current ownership and potential points.\n\n* **QB**\n   * As I mentioned earlier, I would guess at least one of **Ryan Fitzpatrick** and **Taylor Heinecke** will make the team.\n   * **Dwayne Haskins** has found a way to make the team each year he\u2019s been in the league, and he is now behind an aging Big Ben. As an Oklahoma State alum, it pains me to say it, but the Rudolph experiment should probably be over.\n   * I bet **Davis Mills** gets a start for Houston this year, any starter that is less than 5% owned makes this team almost by default. Houston will be bad and a lot of people will leave him unowned, see Flacco last year with the Jets.\n   * Speaking of starters less than 5% owned, **Andy Dalton** will be the week 1 best unowned QB if his ownership remains this low.\n* **RB**\n   * **Salvon Ahmed** checks off a few boxes. Muddled situation, injury prone committee members, and has made the team before. \n   * Any SF RB with under 5% owned, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see **Elijah Mitchell** and **Kyle Jusczyk** on the team at least once this year. **Jeff Wilson\u2019s** ownership will probably dip below 5% just in time for him to fall into a 2 TD week as well.\n   * I mentioned him earlier, but I like **Corey Clement** to be the backup to Barkley and Gallman made this team in that role the last 3 years.\n   * **Kalen Ballage** is eternal. He will find a way to climb the depth chart for one game and then fade again into the ether. In case you have lost track, he is a Steeler now.\n* **WR**\n   * **Byron Pringle** will make this team more than once this year. KC offense has more meat on the bone than Kelce, Hill, and CEH can eat all by themselves. Hardman will be a benefactor, but I suspect Pringle to figure into the mix this year as well.\n   * Buffalo has consistently produced WRs on this team, this year I suspect that to be **Isaiah McKenzie**. Diggs, Gabe Davis and Cole Beasley should remain above 5% owned throughout the year, though Davis or Beasley could dip.\n   * With Julio moving north to Tennessee there are vacated targets aplenty in Atlanta. Ridley, Gage and Pitts will eat a lot of them, but **Olamide Zaccheaus** has been here before and is still unowned. I suspect Atlanta to not be great, so passing volume should be high. \n   * David Moore made the team a lot as a Seahawk and the Seattle passing volume is poised to increase with a new offensive coordinator in town. Metcalf and Lockett are rightly being drafted everywhere, but there is opportunity behind them. Look for **Freddie Swain** or rookie **D'Wayne Eskridge** to find themselves on this list at least once this year. Eskridge is currently on PUP so I\u2019d guess Swain.\n   * Oakland has also produced players for this list, and I\u2019d like to highlight **Hunter Renfrow** once more. The Oaklands WRs are young, and none have fully emerged. Ruggs and Edwards are the favorites, but Renfrow could find himself quite a few targets if he inherits the slot role vacated by Nelson Agholor, a WR3 for fantasy last year. \n* TE\n   * I was surprised at the number of times Ricky Seals-Jones popped up on this list. With him moving on to the WFT, this leads me to look at Cleveland\u2019s TE room. **Harrison Bryant** ought to be a slam dunk to make this team. He is young, talented, huge, had one big 2 TD game last year (and admittedly nothing much else), and he is behind a disgruntled Njoku and the starter, Austin Hooper. He has a great chance at making this team this year.\n   * The Colts have a muddled TE room, and Carson Wentz loves him some TE. Trey Burton is a free agent, opening up 47 targets. **Jack Doyle** will be the starter, but he doesn\u2019t demand a ton of targets, 33 last year. **Mo Alie-Cox** had a couple good games last year and has the size to be dominant. The college basketball player hadn\u2019t played organized football since he was a freshman in high school prior to joining the Colts in 2017. If he can really learn the position he has the measurables to make him a great player. **Kylen Granson** has also impressed as a rookie and the camp reports make it sound like he could be used more as a receiving tight end, where Doyle and Alie-Cox are more suited for blocking. All of the IND TEs show less than 5% Owned on Yahoo and any one of them could emerge and make this team. Sleeper shows Doyle with a higher %Rostered so he may be ineligible.\n   * **Will Dissly** has been great on the field. It just happens two games and then he gets injured. The Seahawks added Gerald Everette, but he hasn\u2019t received more than 41 catches in a season and is more of a blocker. If Dissly can stay healthy he could be the top receiving TE in what should be an improved offense. The aforementioned David Moore was the WR3 for the Seahawks and if no other WR emerges to replace Moore there may be a shift toward more 2 TE sets.\n   * Dissly\u2019s old teammate **Jacob Hollister** could also make the list. Hollister is competing with **Dawson Knox** in Buffalo for the top TE role and Knox hasn\u2019t really stood out. Whichever of the two emerges could be a decently consistent TE option in a top offense. \n   * Other TEs who could make it include **Donald Parham**, **Dan Arnold**, **Dalton Schultz**, and **Jimmy Graham**.\n* K\n   * I won\u2019t spend much time on Kickers, **Dustin Hopkins** is the main one to highlight. Yahoo shows him at 7%, Sleeper at 0%. Either way, he should be more highly owned. \n   * The double-doinker himself, **Cody Parkey** is also the presumed starter in Cleveland. If their offense takes a step forward their Kicker should be reliable weekly as well.\n* D/ST\n   * The currently unowned defenses per Yahoo are **Dallas****,** **Las Vegas****,** **Jacksonville****,** **New York Jets****,** **Atlanta****,** **Detroit****,** **Cincinatti**, and **Houston**. Basically, all the teams expected to be the bottom feeders of the league, and Dallas, who just has a bad defense. Dallas, Vegas, and the Jets would be my guesses to make the team but really they probably all will at some point. \n\n# Welcome to Fantasy Football 2021!\n\nAnything interesting I missed?

Basically how it works is you fill out your top 40, then subtract points for how far off you were.   \n\nExample:   \n\n- If you have Mahomes at #1 and he actually ends up at #5, it's -4 points (1-5). If you have him at #5 and he ends up at #1, it's still -4 points as the difference.      \n- If you have Mahomes at #1 and he ends up at #1, it's 0 points.   \n- If you put any player in the top 40 and they don't end up being on the list, you subtract 101 from whichever rank you had them at. So if you have Mahomes at #1, yet he doesn't make the top 100, you get -100 points (1-101). If you have Mahomes at #40 and he doesn't make the top 100, you get -61 points (40-101).   \n- The theoretical best score is 0 points if you get everything exactly right, and the theoretical worst score is -3,220 if you either name 40 players who all didn't make the top 100, or just don't fill it out.     \n\nHere are my choices (for reference, 41-100 are the players that have already been listed on the NFL Top 100):   \n\n**1.

I used [overthecap](https://overthecap.com/free-agency/) for signings which is good but not the best so I am sure I missed some.  I also used [football reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com) for stats, [Ourlads](https://www.ourlads.com/nfldepthcharts/) for player relevance and past depth charts, and [pro football history](https://pro-football-history.com/) for coaching changes.  I'm sure some mistakes were made along the way and I did this in my spare time over the course of the past couple months so some updates might have been missed as well so be gentle and I'll be happy to make edits/corrections because I'm not a sports writer, this was for me and I am happy to share.  \n\n#Falcons\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. Arthur Smith comes on as the head coach after it was clear that Raheem Morris wasn\u2019t the right coach for the job in the first year.  Arthur had some serious success as the Titans OC seeing as he made very productive players out of Tannehill and Corey Davis who had previously only shown talent but not an ability to put it to consistent use.  Obviously under his offense the Derrick Henry had 2 consecutive monster seasons as well.  Before he was their OC he was their TE coach getting the most out of Jonnu Smith and Delanie Walker.  There is a lot to like about the potential this guy brings.\n2. For OC they brought in Dave Ragone who worked with Smith on the Titans in 2011/2012/2013.  Smith was a defensive assistant/quality control coach then offensive assistant/quality control, then o-line/asst TE coach and Ragone was the WR coach then QB coach so they must have worked closely especially in that 3rd season.  From there Ragone took a season off before coming back to the NFL as an offensive quality control coach with the Redskins, followed by becoming the QB coach for the Bears from 2016-2019 and got upgraded to the passing game coordinator in 2020.  Because Matt Ryan is a completely different QB from Trubisky and widely more talented I won\u2019t try to compare and predict how the offense will run.  This especially considering Smith was a TE coach and they drafted Kyle Pitts.  As pass game coordinator they fed ARob, but that was an obvious move considering he\u2019s the most talented guy on the offense.\n3. Dean Pees also comes over from the Titans, making a lateral move as DC.  This is a great hire considering he\u2019s had success with the Patriots, Ravens, and Titans as DC before this.  However this is probably the least talented roster he\u2019ll have worked with to date so it will be a challenge.  At the very least I see some improvement coming from this hire alone.\n4. The QB coach they hired, Charles London was a RB coach tied to Ragone from his time with the Bears\u2026 again with Ragone as well as Smith in 2011 with the Titans.  I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d hire a former running back, who became a RB coach to be your QB coach but here we are.\n5. They bring in Justin Peelle fas TE coach which is important considering Pitts is going to be the 2nd receiving option on the team.  Peelle had great success as the Eagles TE coach over the years.\n6. They keep their WR coach, they hired a new OL coach who has had success at the college level and is getting his first NFL shot.  Another guy getting his first shot is their new RB coach Des Kitchings who has ascended college coaching ranks in a few different ways and is ready to make the jump.  They hired former Giants DL coach Gary Emanuel which is a solid hire considering their line has been decent. Frank Bush comes in as the LB coach and he\u2019s a great football mind to bring on.  As well as another potentially good hire at secondary coach with Jon Hoke who\u2019d been with the Bucs and the Bears before that.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. WR Julio Jones - Holy shit what a major loss to the team. It was probably the right move at the right time because of it\u2019s unavoidability but you know it still hurts. Ridley has proven he can be the guy with or without Julio and that will remain true but now the number 2 weapon is rookie TE Kyle Pitts. Let the hype train commence.  Russel Gage is going to have to step up in a way we haven\u2019t seen him do without 2 other receiving threats on the field at the same time for.\n2. RB Todd Gurley (FA) - The man\u2019s legs just aren\u2019t what they used to be and it\u2019s a damn shame.  He was still productive in the red zone but just couldn\u2019t break runs the same way.  Mike Davis is coming off of a career season backing up McCaffrey to replace Gurley here but I\u2019m not entirely certain he\u2019ll be much better especially behind that offensive line.\n3. LG James Carpenter (FA) - While he wasn\u2019t a great or even very good LG he was their starter and a veteran of the league.  At this point the only even potentially startable LG on the roster is rookie 3rd round pick Jalen Mayfield who also projected as a tackle.  \n4. S Keanu Neal - Essentially the sole bright spot of a secondary that had a lot of struggles throughout the entire season seemingly.  They also lost his counterpart at safety Ricardo Allen.  2020 4th rounder Jaylinn Hawkins will compete with Duron Harmon to the gap for Keanu.   Also Rookie second rounder Richie Grant will be in the mix.\n5. S Ricardo Allen - He struggled early in the season but got better as the year progressed and to lose him with Neal is not ideal.  To replace him they signed Erik Harris.  Also rookie second rounder Richie Grant will be in the mix.\n6. OL Justin McCray - Rotational depth that is an important loss when Carpenter could end up elsewhere.\n7. DL Allen Bailey (FA) - Rotational player on the defensive line. His loss feels more like addition by subtraction at this stage in the vet\u2019s career.\n8. QB Matt Schaub - Replaced by AJ McCarron as the backup QB.\n9. RB Ito Smith - Probably the weirdest hype train, but yeah he didn\u2019t live up to the bit of hype he carried and now he\u2019s a FA.\n10. S Damontae Kazee - Another loss to the secondary that wasn\u2019t good. He was hurt for most of the year.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. RB Mike Davis - At this point is the sole starting RB.  Qadree Ollison, 2019 5th rounder looks like his only current competition\n2. WR/RB Cordarrelle Patterson - A fantastic special teams addition and seemingly has some gadget viability.\n3. S Erik Harris - Looks like it could be a lateral move to Ricardo Allen but it\u2019s tough to know but neither were good last season is my understanding. \n4. DB Duron Harmon - Harmon has aged like a fine wine in the NFL apparently.  The true journeyman was given his first real opportunity to earn consistent snaps for the Pats in 2018, his 6th season with them.  He filled in as a starter to end the year in 2019. Then last year he was given his first opportunity to completely start with Detroit and played all 16 games.  He was above average on a very bad secondary\u2026 he\u2019ll have to be the same here if he starts.\n5. Edge Barkevious Mingo - He\u2019s rotational depth at this point in his career but ATL is thin at the position so it\u2019s a good pickup\n6. CB Fabian Moreau - Important corner depth that the team lacks\n7. LB Brandon Copeland - Important LB depth\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. TE Kyle Pitts (R1) - Looks like he\u2019s going to be the offense\u2019s number 2 weapon right out of the gate quite possibly.   Can\u2019t wait to watch fantasy owners reach way too high for him but then it still works out since he\u2019s an animal.\n2. S Richie Grant (R2) - He\u2019ll compete to earn snaps and could make a nice impact on the team\u2019s struggling secondary.\n3. OL Jalen Mayfield (R3) - Very possibly could end up starting at LG this year.\n4. C Drew Dalman (R4) - Important center depth\n5. CB Darren Hall (R4) - Important CB depth on a secondary that is putting itself together\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *I love the personnel hires, they potentially might have righted a ship that has been letting on water for the last few staffs. That being said with the players there just look to be more and more holes popping up for the players.  I think the defense remains bad for another season and the offense is incomplete and also isn\u2019t great.  That being said Ridley is still a stud and Pitts very well should be as well.  Mike Davis should be a viable RB2 on volume and Qadree Ollison is one of those true boom or bust grabs because of the potential for him to be the starter that few saw coming.  I\u2019m not a believer in Gage but I know many are.  I just don\u2019t think the o-line will be able to sustain more than Ridley on a consistent basis and I believe in Pitts over him.*\n\n#Panthers\n\n- **Personnel**\n\n1. Minor changes only.  The biggest change was hiring Sean Ryan to be their QB coach. Ryan was the QB coach for the Lions the last 2 seasons, the QB coach for the Texans the 2 before that, and a mix of QB or WR coach for the Giants before that. \n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Teddy Bridgewater - He may not have been the QB of the future for the team but he was solid despite the offense losing its\u2019 best player in CMC.  He sustained 2 1000+ yard receivers and Curtis Samuel had 851 yards on top of that.  Sam Darnold is given offensive talent for the first time in his career so we\u2019ll see how it goes as a replacement.\n2. WR Curtis Samuel - The team\u2019s WR3 but his role was so unique he won\u2019t be replaced.  He had 2 rushing TDs and over 1000 all purpose yards.  The team figured out how to use him more and more as the season went on.  To replace his production they brought in Seahawks receiver David Moore and drafted Terrence Marshall in the 2nd round.\n3. RB Mike Davis - He was handed the reigns for the first time in his career. That was done out of necessity but he stepped up in a big way for the most part.  His season tailed off but there isn\u2019t a replacement on the team so it\u2019s all McCaffrey and nobody behind him. \n4. S Tre Boston (FA) - The team\u2019s starting FS for the past 2 seasons wasn\u2019t as good as earlier in his career and they drafted Jeremy Chinn in the 2nd last season so they probably believe in him to step up this year. \n5. OT Russel Okung (FA) - Spent the last 2 seasons on and off the field for stints. The vet can\u2019t stay healthy.  Greg Little who spent the year on the IR takes his place.  They also brought in Cameron Erving and drafted Brady Christiansen in the 3rd round.\n6. DL Kawaan Short (FA) - Spent the last 2 seasons on and off the field for stints. The vet can\u2019t stay healthy.  2020 first round pick Derrick Brown filled in for his interior usage last year and a few guys rotated in for his DE usage, this year Gross-Matos the 2020 2nd rounder should handle those duties for the most part.\n7. MLB Tahir Whitehead (FA) - He outright stunk last season. He started the year as the starter and finished the year on and off of the field with injury but lost his starting spot. Denzel Perryman is going to be the one filling the hole.\n8. Edge Stephen Weatherly - After getting his first opportunity to start in his 5th season on a 1 year deal with the Panthers he leaves to return to Minnesota.  He was okay before he got hurt and finished the year on the IR.  Efe Obada and Gross-Matos filled in for him. \n9. DT/NT Zach Kerr - He was more or less package based and rotational but he was a serious run stopper. They\u2019re choosing youth to fill the role.\n10. LG Chris Reed - The veteran got his first go at starting and did decently.  There will be a competition to fill the hole but they may have to protect whoever comes into that spot.\n\n11. Edge Efe Obada -Rotational depth.\n\n12. FB Alex Armah - They brought in a UDFA Mason Stokke to fill the role.  Stokke was a LB and switched to FB in 2018 so he\u2019s not as experienced but he has the physical prowess.  We\u2019ll see if he makes the 53.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. QB Sam Darnold - I was a big believer in Darnold when he was drafted out of college but I think at this point he\u2019s shown he isn\u2019t going to be the QB of the future.  As a stop-gap QB let\u2019s try to anticipate what we can expect out of Darnold.  We did see a small boost for Tannehill post-Gase and a very significant bump when he left Miami.  I just worry that we haven\u2019t seen enough attributes or traits out of Darnold in comparison to Tannehill that we knew had tools but never put it together.  Either way he has a 1/2 punch that he was never even close to with the Jets in CMC with DJ Moore and Robby Anderson.  Speaking of Robby Anderson he\u2019s reunited with Darnold so you have an instant connection there but talent always wins out so look to DJ Moore to continue his trend of taking over as the season progresses.  I won\u2019t delve into fit because it\u2019s always night and day from with Gase to without him.\n2. Edge/LB Haason Reddick - Came into his own in his 4th season, the versatile player joins some flash and youth. I think this is a very nice addition if he fits in.\n3. OT/OG Cameron Erving - He struggled with injury last year but the now journeyman will have an opportunity to earn more snaps on the Panthers line who has talent but also holes to fill.\n4. WR David Moore - He\u2019s replacing Curtis Samuel as the WR3 and will have competition with rookie Terrance Marshall Jr. but his experience should be valuable to the offense as a safety net.  He likely won\u2019t be viable as a fantasy player though.\n5. OG/C Pat Elflein - He got hurt early in the season but played every snap of the games he played to finish the year out with the Jets.  That familiarity with Darnold could be helpful but he really wasn\u2019t good but none of the line was\u2026 He\u2019ll compete for snaps/to start.\n6. DL DaQuan Jones - A super nice pickup to the front 7. If they find the right way to use him he\u2019s instantly going to make an impact in the trenches.\n7. CB AJ Bouye - He wasn\u2019t as good in Denver as they\u2019d hoped, getting hurt doesn\u2019t help that but now he won\u2019t have as many responsibilities even if he earns the starting spot and that\u2019s where he really shines.\n8. DL Morgan Fox - Important depth. He could prove to be better than expected just because he was overshadowed by the Rams study d line\u2026 or he could just not be good enough, which is why they brought others in.\n9. TE Dan Arnold - I speak for DHop owners everywhere that this dude was a low-key vulture last season in the worst way because you never saw it coming.  He\u2019s just a good TE and will force Ian Thomas to prove himself.\n10. LB Denzel Perryman - Not a very great pickup but they had to get an inside linebacker one way or another.\n11. CB Rashaan Melvin - He opted out of the 2020 season and joins his former teammate AJ Bouye and will have to earn snaps in what really looks like a deep cornerback unit.\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. CB Jaycee Horn (R1) - Joins a secondary that has potential next season. He\u2019ll have to earn snaps to prove himself but is in a good situation once he does.\n2. WR Terrence Marshall Jr. (R2) - I don\u2019t think he\u2019s super NFL ready but I could be wrong.  He\u2019s a big receiver with good hands but needs to work on his route running. He could have some surprise deep balls in mid season once he learns the offense but before teams figure him out.\n3. OL Brady Christiansen (R3) - Very important depth and lots of opportunity for snaps on the team so he could earn some.\n4. TE Tommy Tremble (R3) - Will be buried behind Ian Thomas and Dan Arnold this season at least.\n5. RB Chuba Hubbard (R4) - He comes in as a change of pace back. He is more of a home run RB and not as many tools in his shed as CMC (but that\u2019s true for most).  He could earn some touches to prevent CMC from having too much wear and tear but I\u2019m not sure about him overall.\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team**\n\n**Assessment** *The personnel are in year 2 and I think ownership is cautiously optimistic on their hires. The team lost a key piece in Curtis Samuel but filled A LOT of holes elsewhere. They focused on the DL, the OL, and the secondary and I think they did a decent job. What matters the most is that it all rests on Darnold shoulders. What is his ceiling? How long will it take him to find it?  I obviously will trust CMC this season and assume he\u2019ll stay healthy.  I also believe in DJ Moore to be a viable player. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be reaching to draft him at all.  Robby Anderson you have to figure will put up consistent numbers and be a safe flex or WR2 play.  The TE position is a tough one to assume a lot of strength but it\u2019s tough to assume with a new QB.*\n\n#Saints\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1.  They lost their QB coach and their defensive back coach to other teams but it primarily stayed the same overall with some shuffling of titles and support positions.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. QB Drew Brees (Retired) - The legend moves on to greener pastures and now it\u2019s up to Jameis Winston and Taysom Hill to fill the void. An impossible challenge for either but we\u2019ve seen some successes with both in some capacity.  The general belief is that it has to be Jameis for the most part but it\u2019s tough to know for sure with Sean Payton.\n2. Edge Trey Hendrickson - He got his first endorsement as a starter and he stepped up in a big way to break out. Marcus Davenport started there the year prior and will be back there this season presumably.  They also drafted Peyton Turner in the 1st round (In anticipation of Cam Jordan aging out soon).\n3. WR Emmanuel Sanders - He probably expected to play with Brees for the most part but he also expected to be the team\u2019s WR2.  With both Brees and Thomas both missing significant time last season (Kamara missing some time too). He was good but not great and that\u2019s fair. There really isn\u2019t a replacement to fill the WR2 void so again it all falls on Thomas and Kamara to lead the way\u2026. With nobody behind them at all.\n4. CB Janoris Jenkins - The veteran CB still played well last season and moved on to the Titans. They drafted Adebo Paulson in the 3rd round and have Patrick Robinson to fill the gap which is definitely going to be a step down.\n5. DL Malcom Brown - This is an actually pretty tough loss to the front 7.  He was good for the patriots for 4 seasons then was good for the saints the last 2 seasons. He doesn\u2019t really have a replacement but you can figure they\u2019ll change up the scheme to match the players.\n6. OL Nick Easton - He was drafted as a center but started as a guard in 15 of the 22 games played for the saints in the last 2 seasons. Cesar Ruiz, 2020 first round pick will fill in nicely presumably.\n7. TE Jared Cook - Normally losing a 34 year old TE wouldn\u2019t be a significant loss but without Sanders the offense is very obviously locked in with MT and Kamara as their 2 main weapons and Taysom Hill as a gadget.  He\u2019s replaced by Nick Vannett\n8. LB Kwon Alexander - The Saints traded for him mid-season and he was below average but okay for them on a rotational basis. \n9. P Thomas Morstead - While he didn\u2019t have the greatest leg, he knew the special teams system well.  He was towards the bottom in punt yards but was top 10 in net yards.  The signed former UDFA Blake Gillikin who was pretty good for Penn State but there were a decent number of punters with a better avg.\n10. TE Josh Hill - We know he isn\u2019t going to be a receiving threat but this is a case of without Cook this loss is more relevant.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. TE Nick Vannett - I suppose he\u2019ll be their receiving TE but my expectations aren\u2019t exactly high.\n2. Edge Tanoh Kpassagnon - He\u2019ll be a nice rotational player on the d line which needed a depth piece.\n3. FB Alex Armah - This is actually really nice for Kamara\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. DE Payton Turner (R1) - A good pickup for the future of their pass rush and doesn\u2019t have to start out of the gate but can compete for snaps.\n2. LB Pete Werner (R2) - A versatile LB with coverage abilities will come in and potentially be their starting Sam and very well could be.  It\u2019s a hole that needs to be filled.\n3. CB Adebo Paulson (R3) - A pick for the future that could also compete for snaps right away.\n4. QB Ian Book (R4) - A shot in the dark for a more conventional backup QB\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *I do like Winston and am a bit of a believer in him.  I think he has the talent to succeed with the coaching that is in place in NO. HOWEVER, he only has 2 weapons on the offense and a weird thing going on where Taysom Hill very well could be the starter.  Essentially the offense did well enough to sustain Kamara without Brees last year so you can assume he\u2019s a safe bet if he\u2019s healthy. Then Michael Thomas is a stud so you can assume he\u2019ll help carry whomever is the QB.  After that it would be a surprise if any of the depth guys emerge as viable fantasy targets.  TreQuan Smith should be the number 2 but I don\u2019t figure he\u2019ll be able to sustain much.  The FB signing is a big indicator of what the teams ants to do.  On the defensive side of the ball I expect a decent drop-off from the progress made in the last 2 seasons.  They did invest in the draft for the future but I don\u2019t see this year being the year that those investments pay off.* \n\n#Buccaneers\n\n- **Personnel** \n\n1. No significant changes at all.  The SB champs tried to keep everyone and they did for the most part.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. OL Joe Haeg - A rotational depth lineman. When this is your worst loss to your SB winning team that\u2019s a very good thing.\n2. OL AQ Shipley - Another rotational depth lineman\u2026 that\u2019s it that\u2019s everyone of even relative significance.  LeSean McCoy had 132 scrimmage yards in 10 games would be the next most relevant drop.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. Gio Bernard - Comes in to fill the void left by McCoy which isn\u2019t a significant one.  I think he fills a need in a very good way as a pass catching back. Fournette was their 3rd down back last season and had enough drops that this move is actually really nice.  It\u2019s the only one of significance that they made and it makes sense.\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. OLB/Edge Joe Tryon (R1) - A great addition to rotate in behind JPP and earn some snaps.\n2. QB Kyle Track (R2) - Could be the QB of the future, could be a bust but Brady was cool with it so nothing to worry about.\n3. OL Robert Hainsey (R3) - Nice OL depth\n4. WR Jaelon Darden (R4) - He won\u2019t see the field any time soon outside of maybe special teams since he\u2019s behind Evans/Godwin/AB/Scotty Miller but he\u2019s more of a gadget speedster so his skillset is different from them. \n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team** None\n\n**Assessment** *See: 2020 Buccaneers.  Apparently Brady didn\u2019t even have the playbook down until closer to week 10 so.  That\u2019s when Mike Evans turned it up in a big way despite playing through some injuries (as he usually does).  It\u2019s also when AB joined the team.  I\u2019ll be curious to see how everything plays out in terms of touches between the 3 receivers and Gronk after a full offseason with the playbook.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes AFC South", "created": 1628554429.0, "players": ["Drew Brees", "Jared Cook", "LeSean McCoy", "Matt Ryan", "Matt Schaub", "Emmanuel Sanders", "Julio Jones", "Allen Bailey", "Patrick Robinson", "Janoris Jenkins", "Tahir Whitehead", "Cordarrelle Patterson", "Barkevious Mingo", "Duron Harmon", "Rashaan Melvin", "Teddy Bridgewater", "AJ McCarron", "Mike Evans", "DaQuan Jones", "Tre Boston", "Ricardo Allen", "Michael Thomas", "Zach Kerr", "Brandon Copeland", "Josh Hill", "Jameis Winston", "Mike Davis", "Malcom Brown", "Denzel Perryman", "Kwon Alexander", "Efe Obada", "Derrick Henry", "Michael Thomas", "Keanu Neal", "Erik Harris", "Nick Vannett", "Robby Anderson", "Stephen Weatherly", "Morgan Fox", "Corey Davis", "Haason Reddick", "Curtis Samuel", "Jonnu Smith", "Tanoh Kpassagnon", "Fabian Moreau", "Damontae Kazee", "Alex Armah", "Trey Hendrickson", "David Moore", "Taysom Hill", "Dan Arnold", "Sam Darnold", "Ito Smith", "Marcus Davenport", "Ian Thomas", "Qadree Ollison", "Scotty Miller", "Derrick Brown", "Richie Grant", "Jeremy Chinn", "Jaylinn Hawkins", "Chuba Hubbard", "Ian Book", "Kyle Pitts", "Dave Ragone", "Jaycee Horn", "Joe Tryon", "Payton Turner", "Tommy Tremble", "Jaelon Darden", "Pete Werner", "Darren Hall", "Mason Stokke"]}, {"author": "slivr33", "created_utc": 1628530867, "id": "p16dhl", "score": 1, "selftext": "I was mostly doing it for myself in draft prep but figured I could dress it up a bit and send it to you guys.

They replaced experienced veteran receivers coach David Culley with first time coaching at the NFL level Tee Martin. Tee\u2019s got a big opportunity considering how bad the receivers were last season and how Baltimore invested in drafting Bateman in the first round. Under the radar it is notable that Rob Ryan joined their staff as an inside linebackers coach. Polarizing personality with a good football mind\u2026 anyways.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. Edge Matt Judon - A huge loss to the Ravens pass rush as he led the team in sacks the past 2 seasons and was 2nd 3 seasons ago. Among many other measurable stats like qb hits, tfl\u2019s, etc.  His replacement will be either Tyus Bowser or rookie 1st round pick Jayson Oweh who didn\u2019t have a single sack this past season of college football. \n2. Edge Yannick Ngakoue - Not as big of a loss as Judon but losing the two of them together isn\u2019t ideal. McPhee played the position most of last year anyways and was.. fine.\n3. ILB Jihad Ward - LB depth\n4. RB Mark Ingram - His window was closing as it was. \n5. WR Willie Snead - WR depth\n6. OL Matt Skura - had a tough go of 2020 and dealt with injury as well\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. G Kevin Zeitler  - A much needed addition to the offensive line.  He has been downtrending the past few seasons but I expect him to have a bounce back year with the Ravens.\n2. Edge Justin Houston - A great deal on this pickup to replace either Judon or Ngakoue, the veteran can be played in many different packages and is still very productive.\n3. T Allejadro Villanueva - Another addition that the Ravens required and therefore acquired.  As a Steeler fan who\u2019s watched Villanueva struggle more and more the past 2 seasons I don\u2019t see this 33 year old big man turning it around significantly. He still has some use in him yet though and will help Phillips, 2020 3rd round pick, develop.\n4. WR Sammy Watkins - The oft injured and streaky but ever talented receiver has found another new home.  He should bring leadership to the WR room with Brown (\u201919), Boykin (\u201919), Bateman (\u201921), Duvernay (\u201920), and Wallace (\u201921).  Can\u2019t wait to miss out on his 1 or 2 huge games but pick him up off of waivers just in case anyways.\n5. C/OG Greg Mancz - Experienced offensive line depth at a very weak position for the Ravens\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. WR Rashod Batemen (R1) - He\u2019s the perfect compliment as a receiver to the speedster Hollywood Brown.  A young WRs coach with a young WR corps should be a fun room and he\u2019s going to have the spotlight.  It\u2019s too early to predict how the pecking order will shake out until after camp. Then later in the season it would be a more viable expectation for Bateman to emerge.\n2. Edge Jayson Oweh (R1) - A physical freak that produced in his rookie season but didn\u2019t last year in college.  He probably will need a large portion fo the season to develop and therefore the Ravens pass rush won\u2019t be as feared as it hsitorically would be.\n3. OL Ben Cleveland (R3) - Another much needed boost to the offensive line. \n4. S Brandon Stephens (R3) - Safety depth that should gain some experience this season depending on the package.\n5. WR Tylan Wallace (R4) - Another young receiver to add to the mix, don\u2019t expect him to make the jump this Eason\n6. Edge Daelin Hayes (R5) - Much needed rushing depth\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning To The Team**\n\n1. OT Andre Smith - The veteran tackle also adds to an offensive line that had its ups but also had its downs in the 2020 season.\n\n**Assessment** *The Ravens saw the offensive line as a need this offseason and boy did they address it? They didn\u2019t exactly get studs but they filled holes nicely. This should provide for an interesting opportunity for the team to provide a fresh new game plan for Jackson.  Likewise it\u2019ll boost their run game.  They also attempted to address their WR struggles but time will tell.  The big questions will be who emerges as the number 2 or even true number 1 receiver.  Hollywood being healthy will also be a big factor as always.  Boykin has the highest ceiling as far as talent goes but the likelihood of that requires development in other parts of his game, Duvernay lacks shiftiness but makes up for it with pure speed/explosion, then of course rookie Batemen clearly will have a role, but at what point?  I do see a potential downtick in the defense because not having as good of a pass rush leads to not having as good of anything else because responsibilities change quickly as plays break down with more time.*\n\n#Bengals\n\n- **Personnel** - No significant changes. They did hire Frank Pollack to be their Run game coordinator/O-line coach who has been with a handful of teams from 2007 until now.  His biggest success came with Dallas in 2016 and 2017 but hasn\u2019t found the right spot to succeed since.. including a previous 1 year stint with Cinci. They also brought in a new RB coach Justin Hill who served as the RB coach at the university of Tulsa for 6 years. They also hired a new d line coach.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. DL Geno Atkins - This talented vet is currently a free agent.  He spent most of the 2020 season hurt or out. When he did see the field it wasn\u2019t as a starter for the Bengals last year as he was beat out by Mike Daniels I believe. There\u2019s a chance he returns but I think bringing in Ogunjobi might have closed that door.\n2. Edge Carl Lawson - Now this is a significant loss to the defense as he was their best player when it came to pass rushing. However they did bring in Hendrickson from NO to replace him..\n3. CB William Jackson - Another big hit to the defensive group that already struggled even with him in the lineup.  His loss is significant to an already struggling secondary/defense.\n4. WR AJ Green - It was time to move on from the veteran former stud WR1 for the Bangals as Boyd had stepped into the top target and Higgins emerged as a very good outside receiver and Burrows just didn\u2019t develop chemistry with Green.\n5. WR John Ross - A bit of an anomaly but his departure made sense as well, especially considering they added JaMarr Chase\n6. TE Cethan Carter - The TE emerged late in the season as a guy that could have potential moving forward but the team is invested in Sample and Uzomah has had some spurts of viability\n7. K Randy Bullock - RIP Fat Randy &lt;3\n8. RB Gio Bernard - An actually important loss for the Bengals in terms of who will handcuff Mixon? Is Perine reallyC their #2 back or will it be 6th rounder Chris Evans?\n9. OL Bobby Hart - Their starting RG, not a great one but an above average one, he\u2019s being replaced by Quinton Spain who is regarded as worse\n10. OL BJ Finney - Depth with NFL experience\n11. DB Mackenzie Alexander - Started 10/13 games played last season, obviously struggled but that\u2019s still a piece down\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. Edge Trey Hendrickson - A huge get for the Bengals to replace Lawson. He had a big breakout year last season so let\u2019s see if that translates over to a new team.  \n2. OL Riley Reiff - A much needed addition to a pretty rough offensive line last season but he is definitely past his prime. \n3. CB Chidobe Awuzie - A not ideal replacement/depth addition for Jackson.  He doesn\u2019t find himself uncomfortable inside or outside but was part of a rough Dallas secondary last season.  It didn\u2019t help that he was hurt/covid for a handful of games. He was decent the year before.\n4. DL Larry Ogunjobi - He\u2019s no Atkins in his prime but he\u2019s got NFL starting experience and can go on either side as a tackle.\n5. CB Mike Hilton - A gadget CB who in the right scheme does very well for himself. Usage will be key for his success.\n6. S Ricardo Allen - Definitely had some struggles early in the year but by the end showed value.  \n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. WR JaMarr Chase (R1) - The first receiver taken in the draft shows plenty of promise.  Reunited with Burrow so that connection and trust is already there.  I expect big things to happen with him earlier than the rest of the WR class considering opportunity, likely favorable game script, and that aforementioned connection.  \n2. OL Jackson Carman - (R2) A much needed addition to the offensive line. He projects to rotate in and have the opportunity to earn more if you ask me.\n3. DL Joseph Ossai (R3) - Depending on how he gets schemed he could be a nice addition from the get go.\n4. OL D\u2019Ante Smith (R4) Depth with upside\n5. DL Cameron Sample (R4) - Depth with potential\n6. NT Tyler Shelvin (R4) - Pure depth\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning To The Team**\n\n1. Deep depth n/a\n\n\n**Assessment** *On their own the secondary signings don\u2019t look great especially considering the loss of Jackson. Their OL will have some growing pains but surely will grow at least a bit compared to last season.  However together it shows promise. I think their front 7 takes a dip but very well could figure it out.  They\u2019re going for the addition by subtraction method and looking for a clean slate but with the same personnel. All in all it rests on the shoulders of Burrow and while I trust the talent, I\u2019m not certain I trust the coaching staff.   The big fantasy implications lie with the receiving corps.  Like a bunch of teams there are more questions than answers at the receiver position. What does the addition of Chase mean for Higgins and Boyd. Boyd had an instant connection and Higgins improved steadily seemingly on a weekly basis.  Considering Mixon is the only RB worth his salt on the team you have to figure they\u2019re going to try to go pass first now that Burrow has his sea legs.  The next question goes towards Burrow\u2019s recovery and health.  Looks like he should be good to go but you never know how that translates come week 1. Should be a fun one to watch.*\n\n#Browns\n\n- **Personnel** No significant changes after the changes made last year paid off.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agent Losses**\n\n1. DT Sheldon Richardson - He\u2019s a real loss to the Browns front 7. He\u2019s still an anchor up front.\n2. DE Olivier Vernon - Also still a free agent but he won\u2019t be returning because of the addition of Clowney.  I\u2019d call it close to a tossup who they would have preferred here, both very good vets of the game.  Clowney\u2019s upside is higher at this point but Vernon fit so well and both are usually good for a couple games missed to injury.\n3. DT Larry Ogunjobi - Not exactly a huge loss but losing him with Richardson hurts the run d\n4. CB Terrence Mitchell - He was a piece to the puzzle last season as he started all 16 games but I don\u2019t think the Browns will miss him since they drafted Newsome, signed Troy Hill, and still have Greedy and Ward.\n5. MLB BJ Goodson - Also still a free agent and they may miss him but he too was replaced by Anthony Walker Jr.\n6. S Andrew Sendejo - The vet started 13 of 13 games last year because Delpit was on the IR most of the year but Delpit is ready to go.  T\n7. S Karl Joseph - Another starter in the secondary for a decent portion of the year.  He won\u2019t be missed but I\u2019m not certain whoever will replace him will be any better. Luckily they have stud CBs.\n8. Edge Adrian Clayborne - Depth.\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. S John Johnson  - Added to play with Delpit and the CBs .  He\u2019s a great addition to a defensive back group that has some serious talent.  He\u2019s arguably one of the top safeties in the league.\n2. DE Jadaveon Clowney - Replaces Vernon, coming off of a down year with Seattle who wasn\u2019t able to scheme him well and where he had to be the guy and couldn\u2019t step up.  With Garrett on the other side it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019ll produce if he can stay healthy.\n3. DB Troy Hill -  He\u2019s a ballhawk that can play out of the nickel and will fit in VERY well with the Browns defense.  He\u2019s coming off of a career season with the Rams last year and joins teammate John Johnson.\n4. DE - Takkarist McKinley - Spent most of last season on the IR and had greater success in his rookie/sophomore seasons when he wasn\u2019t a starter than his 3rd and 4th years but you have to figure he\u2019s instantly going to be a good rotational guy and will be good if he has to step in for Clowney.\n5.  MLB Anthony Walker Jr. - Brought in to replace Goodson, he isn\u2019t graded as highly so it could be a downgrade or it could work out just fine considering the Browns pass rush and secondary make it easy for the position.\n\n- **Relevant Draft** \n\n1. CB Greg Newsome (R1) - A potential stud at CB but doesn\u2019t need to come in immediately and shine because of the depth their secondary has.\n2. LB Jeremiah Owosu-Koromoah (R2) - Instinctual LB that presumably can play all over the field.  He\u2019s a little undersized but matches up well against TEs and should be able to find his place in the league in some capacity. \n3. WR Anthony Schwartz (R3)- Probably won\u2019t see the field much this season but you never know\n4. LT James Hudson (R4) - OL depth\n5. DT Tommy Togiai (R4) - DL depth, after the Browns missed the guy they brought in to play the position last year in Billings\n\n- **Relevant Covid Opt Outs Returning to the Team**\n\n1. DT Andrew Billings - His return will assuredly help the Browns run defense.  The former Bengal will get his chance to play for the team he signed with this year.\n\n**Assessment** *I expect a lot more of the same with a significantly improved defense.  Their game is to ground and pound teams and beat em with the clock and possession because the D can make stops.  Their WR room has talent but lacks any form of consistency to be worth investing in in a big way. OBJ has battled through injuries in the last 4 seasons and did solidly in 2019 through that injury but last year had serious struggles.  At the end Landry was their number 1 guy down the stretch as their offense picked it up but he too has played through injury continuously.  OBJ is clearly the high ceiling on this passing offense especially now that Mayfield is getting more consistent. So when it\u2019s all said and done you look to Chubb and Hunt in terms of fantasy with their D being a good grab too and OBJ being your boom/bust WR2; a solid 6th round grab but he\u2019ll drop before that.  Then Landry could surprise but his window is dwindling.*\n\n#Steelers\n\n- **Personnel** The Steelers promoted QB coach Matt Canada to Offensive Coordinator.  Before he was the QB coach he was Maryland\u2019s OC for a season where he also became their interim HC. He spent about a decade bouncing around very good college programs as their OC/QB coach. It\u2019ll be curious what we can expect out of his offense with the weapons that Pittsburgh has.  Considering those weapons and the fact that Canada has developed a different offense everywhere he went you have to figure early on the Steelers offense could put defenses on their heels (if the line doesn\u2019t fall apart).  The big consistency for Canada is his affiliation to play action/pre snap movement\u2026 something Ben does not like to incorporate often so we\u2019ll see how it turns out. Also brought in was Mike Sullivan to be the QB coach. He spent time as everything from WR coach, to QB coach, to OC from \u201904 to \u201918 then took a year off before returning to his alma mater, Army to recruit before coming back to the league.  The Steelers let go of Shaun Sarrett as O line coach after he struggled to live up to Munchak who proceeded him.  They promoted Adrian Klemm from within. Klemm worked with UCLA in many capacities relating to the line/run game before joining the Steelers.  They also brought in Alfredo Roberts to be TE coach who\u2019s had success in the league on a few teams over the years.  The rest remains the same essentially.  \n- **Relevant Free Agency Losses**\n\n1. Edge Bud Dupree - A huge loss to the pass rush as Bud developed mightily after his first couple seasons.  He\u2019s not the stud that TJ is but his presence had a real impact on the other side. He\u2019s replaced by 2020 3rd round Alex Highsmith who stood out in a very good way stepping into Bud\u2019s position.  Highsmith wasn\u2019t a stud by any means but showed he belongs in the league and that\u2019s all that the Steelers need opposite of Watt.\n2. C Markice Pouncey (Retired) - The anchor to the offensive line for many years retired. His presence in the locker room and on the field will be missed greatly as he\u2019s replaced by backup/rotational guy BJ Finney who had a tough year with the Bengals last season but did decently for the Steelers as a fill-in before. Steelers also drafted Kendrick Green in the 3rd round who will assuredly be the heir to the position and could earn snaps with Finney able to also play guard.\n3. CB Steven Nelson - A tough loss for the secondary but not so tough that the Steelers were willing to cut him to give JuJu an incredibly team friendly contract.  James Pierre and Justin Layne (who was arrested on a gun charge this offseason) will fight for the position while Cam Sutton decidedly handles the nickel work.\n4. OL Matt Feiler - He had his struggles last season but at the end of the day the Steelers lose a starting piece to the offensive line. He has played RT, RG, LG, and LT for stints so his absence will be felt if someone goes down.  Kevin Dotson, who had a stellar rookie season will be stepping up where he would often be.\n5. T - Alejandro Villanueva - He will be less missed as his decline as been steady, but he\u2019s still an NFL quality player. In a bubble losing him doesn\u2019t hurt, but losing him with Pouncey and Feiler is a very tough look for the Steelers offensive line. Chukwuma Okorafor might be the starting LT, which would be pretty not great for the Steelers.\n6. NB/DB Mike Hilton - A surprisingly difficult loss to the Steelers secondary, he found success when the scheme offered it. Cam Sutton inherits his duties.  Another situation where on its own it\u2019s not a bad loss, and the replacement is good but this with Nelson hurts the Steelers depth and Haden is another year older.\n7. LB Avery Williamson - He was brought in to help take over when the Steelers inside linebackers were dropping like flies. He was able to do a bit but ultimately didn\u2019t get totally acclimated to the defense. He was asked a lot and did okay.  He\u2019s still a free agent.  Steelers get Devin Bush back and brought Vince Williams back as well where Spillane stepped in nicely when called upon at the position. They also drafted Buddy Johnson in the 4th round.\n8. RB James Conner - Oft injured and definitely struggled behind our line he finished his career in Pittsburgh on a low note but didn\u2019t go down without a fight and definitely had major successes at points.  He\u2019s replaced by Najee Harris. It\u2019s also worth noting that Canada has ties to McFarland from his time at Maryland.\n9. S Sean Davis - Depth at this point, never lived up to expectation, made plays here and there.\n10. P Jordan Berry - Addition by subtraction for the Steelers, he was near the bottom of the league in punting\n\n- **Relevant Free Agency Additions**\n\n1. Edge Melvin Ingram - A much needed fill-in for Bud Dupree\u2019s production.  He\u2019ll need to remain healthy however.  He\u2019ll compete with Highsmith for snaps.\n2. OL Joe Haeg - Depth\u2026 so not replacing any of the 3 they lost\n3. S/NB Miles Killbrew - Depth\u2026 so not replacing either of the 2 they lost\n4. OL BJ Finney - Bottom tier starter, top tier depth\n5. OL Rashaan Coward - Depth\n6. RB Kalen Ballade - Depth\n\n- **Relevant Draft**\n\n1. RB Najee Harris (R1) - RB1 upside on an offense with a lot of weapons.  If Ben goes down he\u2019ll be startle on volume alone. With Ben his ceiling is higher because of his pass catching ability. Which with that offensive line he\u2019ll need.  His overall viability depends on Canada\u2019s scheme and how much the team can get out of this OL group.\n2. TE Pat Freiermuth (R2) - While I see him getting his fair share of snaps, it\u2019s likely for at least this season that Ebron is going to be the guy until his inevitable doghouse situation due to drops.  At that point you may or may not see a few sneaky starts out of Pat\u2026 but I wouldn\u2019t bank on it actually happening.\n3. C Kendrick Green (R3) - Starter potential, fills a huge hole if he can step up.  He\u2019ll never be Pouncey but Pouncey had his struggles since the departure of Munchak anyways.\n4. OL Dan Moore Jr. (R4) - Depth in a much needed tackle position that will also likely need to step up for the Steelers to have success this season\n5. ILB Buddy Johnson Jr. (R4) - Depth in a much needed ILB position, doesn\u2019t have to come out of the gate with a lot of responsibility\n6. OLB Quincey Roche (R6) - A late round potential steal at OLB, he\u2019s got potential to be first man up if Highsmith can\u2019t play every down.\n7. P Pressley Harvin III (R7) - Punter lives matter, especially big ones with a boomer of a leg\n\n- **Covid Opt Outs returning to the team** None\n\n**Assessment** *Najee instantly becomes a high floor, high ceiling RB in any ppr format due to his pass catching ability.   You are again faced with the decision between Diontae, JuJu, and Claypool.  Roethlisberger isn\u2019t what he once was, but I think the scheme determines his effectiveness. Last season he was getting rid of the ball extremely quick by design and defenses figured out how to game plan for it easily. This year his line is worse and will still want to find his receivers. Juju having taken a discount to stick around and delay his payday was a gamble so I\u2019d put my money on him.  Diontae had a lot of drops last season but has the most potential.  Of course Claypool is the deep threat and more of a RZ target for 1 on 1 battles\u2026 Claypool hit a bit of a rookie wall later in the year because defenses prepared for him and the lack of protection led to his routes not being able to be connected with. I worry that trend continues for Chase.  Ebron is your stereotypical feast or famine on a weekly basis mid-tier TE once again but this time with competition nipping at his heels.*", "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "title": "Every Team's Coaching and Player Changes AFC North", "created": 1628552467.0, "players": ["Adrian Clayborn", "Justin Houston", "Geno Atkins", "Andrew Sendejo", "Olivier Vernon", "Mike Daniels", "Randy Bullock", "Sheldon Richardson", "Vince Williams", "Sammy Watkins", "Ricardo Allen", "Avery Williamson", "Bud Dupree", "Steven Nelson", "Troy Hill", "Brandon Stephens", "Andrew Billings", "Karl Joseph", "Yannick Ngakoue", "Jihad Ward", "Sean Davis", "Matt Judon", "Mike Hilton", "John Ross", "Takkarist McKinley", "James Conner", "Tyus Bowser", "Carl Lawson", "Cethan Carter", "Larry Ogunjobi", "Anthony Walker Jr.", "Chidobe Awuzie", "Trey Hendrickson", "Andre Smith", "Justin Layne", "Najee Harris", "Alex Highsmith", "Tyler Shelvin", "Daelin Hayes", "James Pierre", "Tylan Wallace", "Cam Sutton", "Anthony Schwartz", "Pat Freiermuth", "Anthony Weaver", "Devin Bush", "Tee Martin", "Adrian Klemm", "Joseph Ossai", "Tommy Togiai", "Chris Evans", "Buddy Johnson", "Avery Williams"]}]
