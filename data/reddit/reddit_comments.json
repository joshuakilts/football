Jeudy is probably already a top-10 route runner in the league. Sutton is not all the way back from an ACL tear. Love Jeudy's upside as a year 2 WR\n4. **AB** \\- full offseason with the team, I still think he has a lot of juice left and I just don't believe in Mike Evans who had a hyper efficient season scoring but barely got to 1,000 yds\n5. **Mostert/Trey Sermon** \\- I want one of these two quite simply because SF + Shannahan, this team will rush for about 450-500 times and they boast a top O-line\n6. **Deebo** \\- He's discount Aiyuk, but his injury history is concerning. I simply like him because of his ADP value compared to where you have to draft Aiyuk\n7. **Melvin Gordon / Javonte Williams** \\- MG is the starting RB in Denver but I do expect Javonte to eventually get worked into a 50/50 split. This is a complete shot in the dark either way.\n8. **Jamaal Williams** \\- Talented back brought in to backup a talented 2nd year RB. I see potential in JWill getting a decent amount of touches and providing some weekly value as he did in GB\n9. **Irv Smith** \\- He is primed for a breakout now that Rudolph is gone. Helluva an athlete and  this is more of me not having confidence in Thielen staying healthy\n10. **Darnell Mooney** \\- Just watching him play last year he was so clearly a difference maker for the Bears despite not having an amazing season.  Anthony Miller is out of the picture now and Cohen is still recovering from an ACL. If Fields gets the start, I can see a lot of bombs going to Mooney. I love him as a late round dart throw\n11. **Ryan Tannehill** \\- I am going to keep beating the drum for the QB who I believe has been #3 in PPG since starting for TEN over 2 years ago. He offers a solid rushing floor with scoring ability around the GL too\n12. **Matthew Stafford** \\- best system he's quite possibly been in since he came into the league, he also has legit weapons all over the field, I love Stafford this season\n13. **Trevor Lawrence** \\- My strategy is to grab Tanny/Stafford then have Lawrence to pair with them.

RB fantasy production &gt; WR fantasy production year over year. Just look up prior year fantasy stats and filter out QB's and you will see RB's are always at the top of the list. Why would you draft 3-4 straight WR/TE and/or an early round QB and then pass on the RB production, which is the scarcest position and most volatile at times in fantasy? Another way to frame it is, with good, starting RB's you are GUARANTEED touches/volume (roughly 12-18 touches) and typically goal line scoring opportunities. WR's are much more volatile - unless your Davante Adams - your floor could be as low as a 4-5 catch week and scoring is way harder to predict.\n\nAfter round 4, the RB position drops off hard and is disgusting. I'd say this is arguably where you can get the most value from the WR position. DJ Moore, Julio Jones, Amari Cooper, Kittle, Lockett, Kupp, Aiyuk, Andrews, Godwin, Diontae, all go in round 4-5 currently. Later in the draft, you can grab Chase in the 6th or Robby Anderson and by round 8 you can grab Jeudy or AB as a flex or WR3. \n\nAdditionally, I do not ever advise drafting a QB early because you're almost always passing up a skill position with good value. Last year I drafted Josh Allen in the 10th (#1 QB) and got Justin Herbert off the WW (#9). Another example, in 2019 Lamar Jackson was going in the 8th round and he finished as the #1 QB. In 2018, Mahomes went in the 10th round and finished with a historic season and the #1 QB. See the trend....Every year I look to draft a QB by round 9-11 on avg and it usually works out very nicely.\n\nThis year you can grab Ryan Tannehill in the late 8th, Matthew Stafford in the 8th as well, or Jalen Hurts in the 9th, Ryan Tannehill finished as  the #7 QB last year and believe since he took over in TEN has been top-3 in PPG in that time. My point being that you can take these guys late, there's no need to necessarily gun for Mahomes or Kyler so early.\n\nEnd rant.", "created_utc": 1628802386, "link_id": "t3_p32dxo", "score": -1, "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "created": 1628823986.0, "players": ["Matthew Stafford", "Julio Jones", "Ryan Tannehill", "Davante Adams", "Amari Cooper", "Robby Anderson", "Lamar Jackson", "Josh Allen", "Josh Allen", "Justin Herbert", "Lamar Jackson", "Jalen Hurts"]}, {"author": "PraetorGogarty", "body": "Active players above this:  \n  \n(2) Brady - 79,204 yds  \n(7) Roethlisberger - 60,348 yds  \n(9) Ryan - 55,767 yds  \n(11) Rodgers - 51,245 yds  \n(16) Stafford - 45,109 yds  \n(19) Flacco - 40,931 yds  \n(30) Fitzpatrick - 34,977 yds \n(35) Wilson - 33,946 yds  \n(36) Dalton - 33,764 yds  \n\n\nRemaining active players in the top 100:\n\n(46) Newton - 31,698 yds  \n(60) Cousins - 28,372 yds  \n(67) Tannehill - 26,995 yds  \n(69) Carr - 26,896 yds (nice)  \n\n\nNot doing this for any other reason than I like data.", "created_utc": 1628802134, "link_id": "t3_p2zbi7", "score": 1, "subreddit": "nfl", "created": 1628823734.0, "players": []}, {"author": "amonroe11", "body": "Inherited a team and never done keepers before. 10-team, standard PPR scoring (except passing TDs are worth 6 not 4).

Love that you put yourself out there:\n\nRyan Tannehill: Hes been a top 3 scorer since, hes become the starter. A bit inconsistent but, you cant ignore what hes done. \n\nDarrell Henderson: News is coming out this will definitely be a RBBC, but Henderson will obviously get most of the touches. Maybe like 50-55%?  Gotta remember, its rare for a RB to get 60%+. Beware of his injury history though.\n\nTyler Boyd: Love the value for sure.... IF Burrow starts performing. Burrows having some mental issues in camp, due to his injury, and word is hes not going to play in any preseason games. That sounds so fucking stupid, but hey, what do i know? Feel like he needs preseason games to get more comfortable getting hit again, but again, wtf do i know?\n\nAdam Thielen: He was HIGHLY dependent on TD scoring last year. He took a step back in other categories. TD rates are usually very volatile from year to year. He would need to keep up the insane rate of TDs, to be relevant this next season. Its going to be really hard to do that again, with a better team defense and Jefferson, probably, commanding more targets next year. He is probably best as a WR3 or flex. \n\nJosh Jacobs: Not sure why you are comparing Jacobs to Zeke. Zeke has routinely been involved in the passing game. Jacobs has not... like, not even really close lol, and it fucking sucks, because he 100% should be, as he was great in college at it. Gruden is an idiot for not giving Jacobs those opportunities. Jacobs was a really efficient RB his first first year. But his peripherals really took a plunge last year. Could possibly be due to injuries, but his elusive rating really crashed and burned last year. Then, for some fucking reason, they give a bunch of money to Drake. Fucking idiots. Theres a reason Jacobs has fallen hard in the ADP and all of what I said is why.\n\nLogan Thomas: I think he will be really good option, if Samuel struggles to stay healthy going forward. But, Fitz isnt a fan of passing to the TE much, if he has other options. Hes a slinger and not a check down type that WFT had last year. WFT gave him an extension, which looks promising, but the lack of TE production in Miami, where they had an athletic freak in Gesicki, worries me. But hey, at this point in the draft, any TE around these parts is a lottery ticket.\n\nRaheem Mostert: Agree with what you said. Probably really good hold early on, but hes most likely going to get hurt :/. I think Sermon will then take his role, as hes a beast, but not much of a pass catcher. Def really good value for Mostert to start the year.\n\nGus Edwards: Not sure if he can handle a full load if Dobbins goes down. I know its assumed he could, but of the history of \"handcuffs\", it definitely has not been the case. Edwards is a beast, but not exactly sure he can be a #1 top option in an offense. Hes not really pass friendly. Hes a beast of a runner, though. But we cant assume he can handle a full RB load, as history has shown, backup RBs rarely step up to the task.

It\u2019s not 100%, but if they are playing a team with a bad defense and good offense, there\u2019s a good chance of it being a shootout. Because of QBs being involved in every passing play (I\u2019m aware this is an obvious statement), if the game script points to passing it also points to a good week for the QB. This makes streaming or going with a 1a/1b approach at QB very effective. You cannot do that with a streaming TE. Sometimes you can (against the worst TE defending teams maybe), but even then there\u2019s much less certainty than with QB streaming. \n\nBasically, you can predict peak and valley games with QB more reliably and thus get closer to replicating Mahomes weekly output with on average worse QBs. This smaller gap is what you should be comparing too, not a single QBs season total compared to Mahomes. There\u2019s the opportunity cost of rostering a 1a and 1b, but it\u2019s much better than trying to do the same with TEs.\n\nFor your example of Mahomes, Tannehill, McLaurin, and Samuel: you\u2019ve said it yourself.

You absolutely can patch together solid RB production from the waiver wire, whereas a WR might pop off for 25 and do nothing the next week despite playing the same # of snaps. Take it from someone who drafted Saquon at #2, didn\u2019t draft another RB till round 8 and rode McKissic, Pollard, Bernard and Jeff Wilson Jr to a second place finish - it\u2019s not easy and it\u2019s definitely stressful but it\u2019s also a ton of fun when it breaks right.", "created_utc": 1628732529, "link_id": "t3_p2mlmf", "score": 1, "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "created": 1628754129.0, "players": ["Adrian Peterson", "Alfred Morris", "Latavius Murray", "Carlos Hyde", "Mike Davis", "Malcolm Brown", "Wayne Gallman", "Ito Smith", "Jeff Wilson Jr.", "Ty Johnson", "Tony Pollard", "Salvon Ahmed"]}, {"author": "gotpez", "body": "the disrespect to wayne gallman damn", "created_utc": 1628651465, "link_id": "t3_p24f2h", "score": 5, "subreddit": "fantasyfootball", "created": 1628673065.0, "players": ["Wayne Gallman"]}, {"author": "RepulsiveArm8", "body": "**Trey Sermon**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nSermon is another back whose team traded up to draft him.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nKyle Shanahan has said that Sermon will be a good fit in the team\u2019s zone-blocking scheme.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nIt remains to be seen how Sermon will fare as a receiver, he caught 48 receptions in college and his early-down ability looks promising.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nDespite running a 4.6, 40 time ... leading up to the championship game, Sermon managed to post 524 rushing yards and 3 TDs against Clemson and Northwestern last year for the Buckeyes.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nBefore transferring to Ohio State, he posted 13 TDs as a sophomore at Oklahoma.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nShanahan stated that Sermon has good burst after 10 yards, which might explain his college success and potential in the pros.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nHe\u2019ll have to fend off Raheem Mostert, Wayne Gallman, Jeff Wilson, and Elijah Mitchell \u2026 but Sermon will get a head start with Jeff Wilson sidelined for the first month.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nAnd Mostert has been injury prone, missing 8 games last year.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThe 49ers have shown a willingness to run the past few seasons \u2026 they\u2019ve run over 400 times in every season Kyle Shanahan coached.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nAnd moving up to draft Sermon in the 3rd with a 9th projected offensive line, likely indicates they\u2019ll continue the trend.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThe offensive line ranked 2nd in run blocking last year, and mostly brings back the same unit with the addition of Alex Mack \u2026 who looks to be a competent center.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nMack is also well-versed in Shanahan\u2019s zone-blocking scheme.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nSermon has less wear than other backs entering the league \u2026 only 455 carries compared to Jonathan Taylor\u2019s 926 carries in college.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nAt 6 feet, 215 pounds \u2026 he also might wind up San Francisco\u2019s preferred goal line back.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n**Travis Etienne**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nWe\u2019ve seen rookie RBs flat out thrive as receivers with a heavy share of a team\u2019s passing work before:  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nSaquon Barkley logged 91 receptions as a rookie in 2018.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nReggie Bush caught 88 passes in 2006.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nAnd Alvin Kamara posted 81 catches in 2017.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nEtienne looks like he could be that sort of rookie RB.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nHe\u2019s been lining up as a receiver at Jaguars practice and has gotten rave reviews as a playmaker so far, but Urban Meyer does leave us wondering as to how much usage he\u2019ll see as a runner with James Robinson and Carlos Hyde in the mix.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nEtienne was more than effective on early downs at Clemson (averaging 100 rushing yards in his final 42 games) so it\u2019s possible he finds a way to make it work still despite all the competition.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThe Jaguars spent a 1st round pick on him, after James Robinson\u2019s record-breaking rushing season for an undrafted back, which likely indicates he\u2019ll see the field enough to have a chance to be fantasy relevant.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nIf you recall back at Florida and Ohio State, Meyer drew up a lot of jet sweeps for Percy Harvin and Curtis Samuel.

I actually run an auction keeper league myself (12 years now, slightly different format for the 6 years before that) and we don't allow FA keepers.\n\nOur keeper rules are:\n\n- 3 keepers max\n\n- 1st time being kept is +$7 or +20% (greater)\n\n- 2nd time being kept is +$12 or +20% (greater)\n\n- 3rd time being kept is +$20 or +20% (greater)\n\n- can't be kept a 4th time (by any team)\n\n- Any player who is dropped can be immediately picked up by another team and retain keeper status. Once someone clears waivers, they lose their keeper eligibility. Anyone who's not drafted/picked up in the first waiver run of the year cannot be kept. \n\n- teams can trade up to +/- $30 of their next year auction dollars to make in season moves.\n\nTo be clear, nothing \"breaks\" or \"ruins\" anything. All rule set ups are fine, they're just choices and encourage different behavior. But we chose to do it that way to force people to think ahead about keepers, spend a bit more on young guys, and play the risk/reward game of stashing guys who could be valuable for future seasons but using a roster spot for them. \n\nIt was initially set up that way before ESPN offered FAAB, when reverse order of standings was the way things got sorted out on waivers, and it felt like a massive advantage to be in last to grab guys like Vick when they blew up. I still think it's preferable to allowing FA keepers... No NFL team gives a mid year FA signing a 3+ year deal when they sign them in October after their starting RB gets hurt. \n\nSomeone drafted Kamara his rookie year for $1 and had 4 seasons of fun. Guys like Chase and Lamb and Javonte Williams, but also Rondale Moore and Bateman and others get fought over at the end of our auction (was last night), because people are mining for future value. But we also miss guys like Chase Claypool, who come from nowhere. It actually works well, because those guys (and the high priced guys who have already been kept 2-3x) end up being the fodder for deadline deals.

Out of 156 pass attempts towards Wright in 2019-2020, 115 have been completed (73.7%) for over nine yards per completion.

In 2004, he ran for 1,005 yds and 7 TDs. \n\nIn 2009, **Chris Johnson** ran for 2,006 yards and 14 TDs. In 2010, he ran for 1,364 and 11 TDs.\n\nBarry Sanders, OJ Simpson, and AP also saw similar decreases. I know Henry is a monster, but I would not advise anyone to draft him at 1.01, but rather CMC especially in PPR leagues. In non PPR leagues, I think Henry should go as high as 2 but this is all my personal opinion.

What is really cool about it was, if it was a jump ball, the defender was running at 100 percent at the tail end of the catch, and Randy would be at 80 percent and more under control for the jump ball.\u201d\n\nYou read that right. If Moss wasn\u2019t playing the best of the best he played at a slower pace to give himself an ADVANTAGE.\n\nSando also revealed what former opponents thought.\n\nLeRoy Butler relished competing against the NFL\u2019s great offensive players as an acclaimed safety for the 1990s Packers. With one exception.\n\n\u201cWhen I played Jerry Rice, I was excited \u2014 \u2018Oh, man, I\u2019m playing the GOAT,\u2019 \u201d Butler said. \u201cCris Carter, OK, we have to be smart about how we are going to double. Herman Moore, he is going to catch a lot of passes\u2019 we\u2019ve gotta get him on the ground because he is so big.\u201d\n\nMoss triggered a more visceral reaction.\n\n\u201cRandy Moss, your heart is on an EKG machine and it explodes,\u201d Butler said. \u201cYour heart is thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to be on SportsCenter. He is going to jump over me and catch it, and I just got Mossed.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMost fans have maintained that if Moss would\u2019ve had the work ethic of Jerry Rice, he likely would\u2019ve gone down as the greatest football player of all time. Stories like these just further that case.
